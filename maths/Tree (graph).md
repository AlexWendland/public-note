# Tree (graph)

A tree is a [[Connected (graph)|connected]] [[Graph|graph]] which has no [[Cycle (graph)|cycles]].

## Equivalences

The following conditions are equivalent. 
 1. $G$ is a tree.  
 2. $G$ is [[Connected (graph)|path connected]] and $\vert E \vert = \vert V \vert − 1$.  
 3. $G$ has no [[Cycle (graph)|cycles]] and $\vert E \vert = \vert V \vert − 1$.
