# Wendland Weekly Index

This is my vain attempt to publish a note once a week, about anything that takes my fancy that week! The point isn't to be good, just to break the barrier to just writing something.

# List
- [[2023-W08]]: Markdown actually learning it.
- [[2023-W09]]: First steps into a [[Fast API]] course.
- [[2023-W11]]: Naming variables - my dilemma.
- [[2023-W13]]: Logging.
- [[2023-W16]]: Why is ~10 = -11?
