## Ideas

- Donations portal: Gamify giving to charity.
  - "Make giving feel great again!"
  - Emphasise impact. (Benchmark against 'life years saved'.)
  - Plug into 'give as you earn'.
  - Corporate sponsorships.
  - Events such as charity runs.
  - Partner with volunteering opportunities.
  - Integrations with all major charities.
  - Simplified payment process.
  - Social media integration?
  - Behaviour Psychology tricks 'people in your area on average give X or X%'
  - Integration with 'Giving pledge'.
  - Business model: Take 0.1% of donations (based on https://www.nptuk.org/philanthropic-resources/uk-charitable-giving-statistics/)
    - 62% of people in the UK donate to charity (41 Million)
    - Average monthly donation: £49
    - Total donations yearly: £24.1 Billion
    - If 1% went through our platform £241 million
    - If we took 0.1% of that, that would be £241,000 a month.
    - 10% profit margin would be £24,100 a month.

- Data bank account: A place to store your data.
  - "If data is the new gold, you should own it."
  - We would need to be trusted with data for this to work.
  - A place to store all your data.
  - Integrations galore!
  - Business model: Enable users to sell access to their data.
    - Users get offered a price for their participation in studies (random chance for a payout).
    - We take a fee from the study for the data.

- Who's who of politics: Seem knowledgable in one simple interface
  - LLM backed data scrapping on politicians.
  - Creates simplified 'political player cards'.
  - Highlights there positions on key policies.
  - Scrapes public voting records.
  - What is the business model here? Maybe political betting integrations.

- (Something to do with MCP integration with common applications)

- Board game league: Decentralised board game leagues
  - "Strava but for board games"
  - Find players who are a similar skill level to you.
  - Suggests games and meet ups.
  - Submit scores and have a personal leader board.

## AOB

- What commitment do we want to this?

- Time lines.
  - I have to make a decision whether or not to do a course next term.
    (Next week)
