The things that immediately come to mind:

- I want to be physically intimate with people.
  That could be sex, but also just touching and cuddling with people.
  Most probably didn't get enough of this when I was younger or something.
  Honestly, I have always have this drive but for so long told myself I needed to resist it because I didn't like myself or my body.

- I want to think I am physically attractive.
  I have not had this for a long time and now I am closer to it, I am terrified of losing it.

- I want to have done something I am proud of and other people find useful.
  This does not need to be a source of income but 'leading' a group or an idea I find motivating.

- I think I do want money - no matter what I tell myself.
  I am drawn to saving and being tight.
  Though I do not relish in the buying of things or spending of money, I also don't want to have to think about it.
  Though I often find myself looking at my savings - I think as a source of safety?

- I think I want to be respected for some skill.
  Just being able to do something most people can't gives me a sense of pride.

- I want someone to be a stable part of my life.
  I really love Janet and I think she is that person.
  However, sometimes I feel conflicted in that in the sense that I need time by myself also.
  I also maybe feel a little trapped in what I can do with other people because of monogamous relationship.
  Honestly, I think also I feel a bit frustrated - for me something that happens outside of the time we are together and does not effect that time, doesn't really matter.
  However, society is SO judgey about it - whereas morally I just see nothing wrong with sex with other people.
  I don't know if this difference is morals is insurmountable or this drive will just die with time.
  I just don't want to do anything to hurt Janet ... but I am worried I might.

- A mix of stability and adventure.
  I am not a huge fan of traveling, I think I would rather stay in one place.
  Though too much of the same I find really boring and get in exactly the mood I am in right now.

- I want to be known as reliable and honest.
  However, I feel like I am miles away from this.
  The temptation to lie to make something funnier or cooler is so strong.

Things I have enjoyed in the past:

- I like board games, playing them gives me a physical thrill.

- I love dancing with somebody.
  Then tension and thrill is such a rush, especially when what is going to happen is unknown to me.

- I get such a rush from being in a sex-positive space, such as club verbotten, fox and badger or even just a Shibari workshop.

- I love reading a good sci-fi book, just getting lost in the story.

- I really liked just sitting on the beach with nothing to do.

- I have liked computer games, the 'just one more thing' feeling of them is great.

- When the project is right, I love programming.
  The feeling of actually building a thing is amazing.
  However, I really hate figuring out why something is not as I want it to be.

Things I have been told I should want:

- A calm mind, where I can commit to things fully.
  (I actually really do want this.)
  Though I feel a mile away from it - even writing this I can feel myself being drawn away.

- Not to rely on others for a sense of happiness - shedding my insecurity.
  This feels SUPER counter-intuitive to me.
  I have always been super motived by others, it feels so strange to just suddenly say I should minimise that.
  I understand the rational argument, others are fickle and can not be relied on for my own happiness.
  My own actions are really the only thing 'I control' but still ... isn't the whole of society set up to reward working with and for others?

- Being a good person and donating to people who have a lot less in life.
  I do do this but honestly ... I am kind of ashamed it does not make me 'feel good'.
  I accept I should do it on a rational level but not on an emotional one.

- I want to be consistent and have a set of morals I live by.
  However, I find any consistency hard - everything has payoffs and honestly my memory is not good enough to remember the positions I have held in the past.

I think I am infatuated with the idea of greatness but I am too lazy to achieve it.

2. Safety - Security, stability, freedom from fear
3. Love/Belonging - Relationships, intimacy, social connection

5. Self-Actualization - Personal growth, creativity, fulfilling potential
