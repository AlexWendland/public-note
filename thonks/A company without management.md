If I work for a company, some things I want from it are:
- I want to work in a company with as little 'management' as possible. (Should most probably expand on why in another note.)
- I want to work with people I like and respect their life choices.
- I want a work culture that supports people in whichever life stage they are at. (I flick between all of these often but sometimes work feels a bit like a trap and I can't be honest about it as it doesn't fit the company culture.)
  - What to really work hard on something your passionate about, great.
  - You are having a kid and need lots of time off, awesome we can make that work.
  - Just here for the 9-5 and happy with the steady income, no problem.
- I want to work on something I enjoy.
- I want to work in a company where transparency is key. For example, I want salary/bonuses to be completely open. (Could this work? I want to write about this.)
- A company where profit is part of the goal, but excess profit is either used to lower prices, decrease work hours, or increase donations. (See [[How I think about work]] for why I don't see paying people *loads* of money is that useful.)

I guess most people want what is above and to the best of my knowledge it does not exist.
So maybe it is impossible or maybe I choose companies where it is not possible.

I guess the payoffs for the above could be:
- A much smaller salary.
- Lower chance of investment.
- Higher risk when markets move against you.
- More attractive to people in early stage careers.
