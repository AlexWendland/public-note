# public-note

These are my notes that are available on my [website](https://obsidian.awendland.co.uk/Welcome).

## To do list

- [ ] Build workflow to auto publish updates on git push.
  - Think I'll use hugo, need to get this up and running first though.
- [x] Build workflow for excalidraw files (locally change, and reference within notes)
- [x] Update lecture workflow to be able to toggle between courses.
- [x] Create cli tool to update the last edited for all the files.
- [ ] Update internal repo references from Obsidian format to markdown format.
