# Functions in Python
[[Functions]] in [[Python]] are a class and have type 'function'. i.e.

>\>\>\> type(my_function)
>\<class 'function'\>

They have their own [[Namespace]] that gets destroyed once the function call has ended. In [[Python]] functions are [[First-class object|First-class objects]], meaning they can be assigned to variables. 

# Properties
## \_\_doc\_\_
This returns the [[Docstring]] of the function.
