# Git
This is my preferred (well ... to be honest the only one I have used) version control system. It allows complete distributed development on code, though most people use a centralised version of this on [[GitHub]] or [[GitLab]].  

# Index

- [[GitHub]]
- [[Using multiple git profiles]]
- [[Pre-commit hooks]]
