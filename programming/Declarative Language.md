# Declarative Language
This is a language that specifies the desired end state. So it is the picture on the front of the Ikea manual rather than the instruction manual!

# Examples
- [[Markdown]]
- [[Markup Language]]

# Thoughts
A good [[User Interface (UI)]] should be declarative with the system behind the scenes doing the leg work to get to that state. This paradigm is being applied more and more within [[DevOps]] for example [[Kubernetes]] and [[Terraform]] both you specify the end state and the program sorts altering the current state to match this.
