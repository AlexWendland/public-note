# Statement

> [!tldr] Find [[Path (graph)|path]] between vertices in an [[Graph|undirected graph]]
> Given an [[Graph|undirected graph]] $G = (V,E)$ and two vertices $a,b \in V$. How can we find a [[Path (graph)|path]] in $G$ between them. Sometime we will also have a weighting $W: E \rightarrow D$ and we want to minimise the path length.
