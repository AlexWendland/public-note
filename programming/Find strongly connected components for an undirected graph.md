## Statement

> [!tldr] Find [[Strongly connected components (directed graphs)|strongly connected components]] in an [[Directed graph|directed graph]]
> Given a [[Directed graph|directed graph]] $G = (V,E)$ how can we find a mapping from it's vertices $V$ to the [[Strongly connected components (directed graphs)|strongly connected components]] of $G$.

## Solutions

- 
	- This runs in $O(\vert V \vert \cdot \vert E \vert)$ time.
