## Statement

> [!tldr] Find [[Connected components (graph)|connected components]] in an [[Graph|undirected graph]]
> Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ how can we find a mapping from it's vertices $V$ to the connected components of $G$.

## Solutions

- [[DFS to find connected components in an undirected graph]] 
	- This runs in $O(\vert V \vert \cdot \vert E \vert)$ time.
