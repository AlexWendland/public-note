# First-class object
This is an entity that can be:
- Created at runtime,
- Assigned to a variable or element in a data structure,
- Passed as an argument to a function, and
- Returned as the result of a function.

In [[Python]] most data types are First-class objects such as [[Integers]], [[Floats]], [[Dictionaries]], [[Lists]] and [[Functions]].
