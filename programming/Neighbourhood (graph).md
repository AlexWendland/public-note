>[!tldr] Neighbourhood
>For a [[Graph|undirected graph]] $G = (V,E)$ the neighbourhood of $X \subset V$ is $N(V) = \{u \in V \vert (x,u) \in E\}$ ($\backslash X$, $\cup X$). Sometimes this will be defined to include $X$ or exclude $X$ - this is sometimes called open and closed neighbourhoods.

## Directed graph

In a directed this would normally be specified inbound and outbound edges
