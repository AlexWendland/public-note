# Week 2 - Reinforcement learning basics

When evaluating different learners we normally evaluate them by the [[Policy (MDP)|policy]] they produce. However, different methods of learning can create policies in different ways - therefore we may need to also consider:

- **Computation complexity**: The time it takes for that learner to come up with that policy.
- **Sample complexity**: The amount of interactions with its environment it needs to come up with that policy.

We don't normally think about *space complexity* as with other subjects - as that is not normally a limiting factor.
