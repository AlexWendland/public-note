# Week 10 - Feature selection

Feature selection is the process of deciding what features of the data are worth training on. Then picking the subset of them that are the most important. The reason to do this is:
- Knowledge discovery, interpretability, and insight. 
	- When you get the results back you are going to have to be able to explain them.
- [[The curse of dimensionality]]
	- If you put too many dimensions in - it will decrease the accuracy of your models!
