# Week 1 - Chapter 1 Machine Learning

This is my notes from the first chapter of [[MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf]].

# 1.1 Well posed learning problems

![[Machine Learning]]

>[!example] Checkers
>If we want a programme to learn at checkers we simply need to define $T$, $P$, and $E$!
>- Task $T$: playing checkers,
>- Performance measure $P$: percentage of games won against opponents, and
>- Training experience $E$: playing practice games against itself.
