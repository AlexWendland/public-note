# Week 10 - Feature transformation

[[Dimensionality reduction|Feature transformation]] is the problem of pre-processing a set of features to create a new (smaller/compact) feature set, while retaining as much information as possible. It is a map $p: \mathbb{F}^N \rightarrow \mathbb{F}^M$ where you usually want $M < N$.

In this course we will focus on [[Linear dimensionality reduction|linear  feature reduction]] where $p$ is a [[Linear map|linear map]].

>Feature selection is a special case of feature transformation

## Problems to overcome

If you think of features in analogy to language there is two problems when using a feature to label data.
