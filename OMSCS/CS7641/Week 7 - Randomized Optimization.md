# Week 7 - Randomized Optimization

We are now moving onto to [[Unsupervised learning]].

![[Unsupervised learning]]

The difference from [[Supervised learning|supervised learning]] is we don't get given labels - so how we actually learn the function is beyond me!

## Optimisation problem

![[Optimisation problem]]

There are lots of examples of this.
- Process control or optimisation, think chemical factory.
- Finding a route on a map.
- Find a root of a function!
- Neural network weights.
- Minimising error in another model!

There are a couple of good methods here: 
- Generate and test
	- Good when we have a small input space but complex function.
- Calculus:
	- We need the function to have a derivative and solvable!
- Search method like [[Newton Raphson method]]
	- Similar problems to calculus.
- Random Optimisation, todays lecture :)

## Simulated Annealing

The next class of algorithms is like hill climbing but we allow for a bit more random walking.

![[Simulated Annealing]]

Notice with the formula that if $T \rightarrow 0$ then this will make $P(x, x_t, T) \rightarrow 0$ for points where $f(x_t) < f(x)$ so it will start acting like [[Hill climbing]] whereas as $T \rightarrow \infty$ we have $P(x, x_t, T) \rightarrow 1$ so it will be close to a random walk.

## Genetic Algorithms

In all the above examples, we just updated our next guess based on local properties. However, we might find a couple of points with good fitness and want to combine them to find out what properties they have that provide that good fit. 

![[Genetic algorithm (meta)]]

For the [[Crossover (genetic algorithms)|crossover function]] lets consider a concrete example.

>[!example] 8-bit strings crossover example
>Suppose $A = \{0,1\}^8$, how could we design a [[Crossover (genetic algorithms)|crossover function]]?

Suppose we are merging $00011011$ and $00110010$.

### One point crossover

We could choose an arbitrary point and do a switch of bit before and after this point. For example $C(00011011, 00110010) = (00010010, 00111011)$ where the first 4 bits of the first output is from the 1st input and the second 4 bits if from the second input - then vice versa for the second output.

### Uniform crossover

We could instead choose bits at random - either uniformly or weighted by their fitness. For example $C(00011011, 00110010) = (00010010, 00111011)$ where for the 3rd, 5th and 8th bit we choose from the first, second and second for the first output and vice versa for the second.

## Crossover choice

Notice that any choice of [[Crossover (genetic algorithms)|crossover function]] relies heavily on how you represent your data!

## Randomised algorithms

All the randomised algorithms here have been fairly simply and don't use history. There are more complicated ones that combine ideas from different algorithms and try to model the area they are searching. 

## MIMIC

## Estimating the probability distribution using dependency trees

![[Dependency Trees (Bayesian Network)]]

As always lets assume we are in the [[Modelling framework|modelling framework]] and we can break down our [[Function domain|domain]] $A = \oplus_{i=1}^n A_i$ into features, we assume similarly the random variable $X$ breaks down equally $X = \oplus_{i=1}^n X_i$. 

To build a probability distribution on $A$ we will model it using a [[Dependency Trees (Bayesian Network)|dependency tree]].  Where $\mathbb{P}[X_i = a_i]$ will be the probability that an input uses $a_i$ in the $i'th$ feature and has a fitness function larger that $\theta_j$ for some step $j$. Similarly for $\mathbb{P}[X_i = a_i \vert X_j = a_j]$ however we are assuming that $i'th$ feature is for some reason dependent on the $j'th$.

Just like with [[Bayesian network]] we can calculate $\mathbb{P}[X_i = a_i]$ and $\mathbb{P}[X_i = a_i \vert X_j = a_j]$ using the samples - however unlike the [[Bayesian network]] each time we do this we need to pick the most meaningful relationships to use. 

## Generating your dependency tree

At this point it is best to listen to [[Week 7 - Information Theory]] to get the terms required for this proof.

Now for every choice of $\pi$ to define the [[Dependency Trees (Bayesian Network)|dependency tree]] lets try to minimise the [[Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence|KL-divergence]]. We are going to assume we have the perfect probability distribution $p$ and we are modelling it using our dependency tree $\pi$ where
$$
p_{\pi}(a) = \prod_{i = 1}^n p(a_i \vert a_{\pi(i)})
$$
here we are making the assumption when $\pi(i) = \emptyset$ we do the right thing. Moreover we are assuming we are using the real distribution $p$.
$$
\begin{align*}
D_{KL}(p \vert \vert p_{\pi}) = & \sum_{a \in A}^n p(a) \left [ \ \log(p(a)) - \log(p_{\pi}(a)) \ \right ]\\
= & - \left ( - \sum_{a \in A} p(a) \log(p(a)) \right ) + \left ( - \sum_{a \in A} p(a) \log(\prod_{i=1}^n p(a_i \vert a_{\pi(i)})) \right )\\
= & - H(p) + \sum_{i=1}^n \left (- \sum_{a \in A} p(a)\log(p(a_i \vert a_{\pi(i)})) \right ) & \mbox{by log and Entropy}\\
= & - H(p) + \sum_{i=1}^n \left (- \sum_{a_i \in A_i} \sum_{a_{\pi(i)} \in A_{\pi(i)}} p(a_i, a_{\pi(i)})\log(p(a_i \vert a_{\pi(i)})) \right ) & \mbox{by marginalisation}\\
= & - H(p) + \sum_{i=1}^n H(a_i \vert a_{\pi(i)})
\end{align*}
$$
Where $H(a_i \vert a_{\pi(i)})$ is [[Conditional entropy]]. Then as $-H(p)$ doesn't depend on $\pi$ when looking for a maximum $\pi$ we can ignore it. Though as it is mathematically convenient we will add $- \sum_{i=1}^n h(a_i)$. All together this is
$$
\begin{align*}
\min_{\pi} J_{\pi} & = \left ( - \sum_{i=1}^n H(a_i) + \sum_{i=1}^n H(a_i \vert a_{\pi(i)}) \right )\\
& = \sum_{i = 1}^n - I(a_i, a_{\pi(i)}) & \mbox{by definition of mutual information}\\
\end{align*}
$$
Where $I(a_i, a_{\pi(i)})$ is [[Mutual information]]. We get a cool result here before we had $p(a_i \vert a_{\pi(i)})$ is which is directional but $I(a_i,\pi(a_i))$ is not as [[Mutual information is symmetric]]. 

So we just need to calculate $-I(a_i, a_j)$ for every pair of $i$ and $j$. Then we can find an [[Minimum Spanning Tree problem (MST)|MST]] in the complete graph on $\{1, 2, \ldots  n\}$ where the edges $(i,j)$ are weighted by $-I(a_i ; a_j)$.

Once we have the [[Minimum Spanning Tree problem (MST)|MST]] we can choose an arbitrary root and direct the edges accordingly!

Now we have the [[Dependency Trees (Bayesian Network)|dependency tree]] structure we can generate the probabilities using our samples.

Bringing this all together we have the algorithm.
