# Week 1 - Writing and reading papers

## Ten simple rules for reading a scientific paper by Maureen A. CareyID, Kevin L. Steiner, William A. Petri Jr

Reading articles is a large part of research and you should try to keep up to date with your area of interest. However, may people struggle with reading articles and this guide is some tips and tricks for starting.

### Rule 1: Pick your reading goal

Understand why you want to read this paper, and set your priority straight from the beginning so you don't get lost in the forest of knowledge. 

### Rule 2: Understand the author's goal

You may be able to work this out from the introduction. Though try to take into account other publication titles of that author. Ask questions like is this paper in the authors field? Are they working towards a bigger goal? What are their scientific interests? This is hard at first but as you get more a custom to an area gets easier. 

A good first step to understand the type of article: methods, review, commentary, resources, and research articles. 

### Rule 3: Ask six questions

For each article ask:
1. What do the authors want to know (motivation)?
2. What did they do (approach)?
3. Why was it done that way (context)?
4. What do the results show?
5. How was this interpreted?
6. What should be done next?

This can be done for each table/figure as well as for the paper as a whole.

### Rule 4: Unpack each figure and table

The data is the most important part of the paper - starting with that to understand the words around it can help. For graphs, you should be able to explain all the components, axises, colours, and statistical approach. For each table understand what are the experimental groups, variables presented, and what was calculated vs collected.  

### Rule 5: Understand the formatting intentions

Understand why the author grouped results into different sections and what the goal of each of them was. This can be helped by understanding the usual roles different bits of the paper are to achieve.

### Rule 6: Be critical

>[!quote] Science is a never-ending working in progress

Whilst models have their [[Bias (modelling)|bias]] so do do humans and the author may have missed something. We all come with [[Confirmation bias|confirmation bias]] of our own hypothesises.

Always start with the data and see if you agree with their conclusions from that. Are there potential other conclusions that could be drawn.

### Rule 7: Be kind

Don't let poor formatting or incorrect labelling influence your opinions about the quality of the results. People make mistakes.

When talking to colleges about papers try to be kind when it comes to little mistakes and don't dwell on them. 

### Rule 8: Be ready to go the extra mile

Some people suggest the read it 3 times approach:
1. Read without need to critic or understand anything.
2. Aim to understand the paper and what it is saying.
3. Take notes and extract information from it.

You may have to chase down references, look up terms and find out supplementary material to understand what is going on. (Though I strongly argue this is a poorly written paper.)

### Rule 9: Talk about it

Reading papers with people and talking about them is a great way to get a different perspective on the information. Another option is to talk to other people and try to teach them results in the paper.

>[!quote] To teach is to learn twice

Social media or within your research group has become a great way to learn.

### Rule 10: Build on it

The point of reading papers is so you can do more. Think about how to apply methods within a paper to one of your own projects. Or if you can use results from this paper to help you. Science is not a spectator sport.
