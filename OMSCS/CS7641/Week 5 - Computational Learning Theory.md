# Week 5 - Learning Theory

[[Computational learning theory]] is fundamentally about 3 things:
- defining learning problems,
- show algorithms work, and
- showing problems are easy or hard. 

When considering problems it is useful to think about:
1. The probability of successful training. 
2. Number of examples you need to train on.
3. Complexity of the hypothesis class.
4. Accuracy to which the target concept is approximated. 
5. Manner in which the examples are presented.
6. Manner in which the [[Training data|training data]] is collected.
