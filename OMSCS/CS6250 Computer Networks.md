# CS7641 Machine Learning

This course provides a quick refresh of introductory material, and offers a broad coverage of protocols and algorithms that span across all layers of the Internet protocol stack.

The course begins with an overview of the evolution of the Internet architecture and a short refresh of the transport layer algorithms and protocols such as TCP and congestion control. Next, the course will dive into intradomain/interdomain routing, peering and networks relationships with a follow-up into router design and functionalities. After discussing routing and router technologies, the course will continue with Software Defined Networking technologies and discuss topics that intersect Network Security and Computer Networks, for example, attacks on Internet routing such as BGP hijacking. Finally, the course wraps up with a discussion on multimedia applications and Content Delivery Networks.

Throughout the course, students will work on hands-on projects to learn about routing, SDN, BGP hijacking, and Internet measurements. For students who would like to explore more, there is an additional project that engages with tools for Internet-wide measurements. As part of the project, students will study how large-scale events that are associated with unrest are reflected as connectivity disruptions for networks in specific parts of the world.
