From [Algorithms](http://algorithmics.lsi.upc.edu/docs/Dasgupta-Papadimitriou-Vazirani.pdf) by S. Dasgupta, C. Papadimitriou, and U. Vazirani.

> [!question] Problem 8.1 TSP optimization versus search
> Recall the traveling salesman problem:
> ![[Traveling salesman problem (search)#Statement]]
> and the optimisation version of the problem:
> ![[Traveling salesman problem#Statement]]
> Show that if [[Traveling salesman problem (search)|TSP search]] can be solved in [[Polynomial time|polynomial time]] then we can solve [[Traveling salesman problem|TSP]] in [[Polynomial time|polynomial time]] also.
