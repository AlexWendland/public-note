# Week 10 - Homework 6 (unassessed)

From [Algorithms](http://algorithmics.lsi.upc.edu/docs/Dasgupta-Papadimitriou-Vazirani.pdf) by S. Dasgupta, C. Papadimitriou, and U. Vazirani.

> [!question] Problem 8.1 TSP optimization versus search
> Recall the traveling salesman problem:
> ![[Traveling salesman problem (search)#Statement]]
> and the optimisation version of the problem:
> ![[Traveling salesman problem#Statement]]
> Show that if [[Traveling salesman problem (search)|TSP search]] can be solved in [[Polynomial time|polynomial time]] then we can solve [[Traveling salesman problem|TSP]] in [[Polynomial time|polynomial time]] also.



>[!question] Problem 8.2 Search problems vs Decision problems
>Suppose you have an [[Polynomial time|polynomial time]] algorithm that tells you if there is a [[Rudrata path]] in a given [[Graph|graph]] $G$. Show that you can use it to develop a [[Polynomial time|polynomial time]] algorithm to solve the [[Rudrata path problem]].



>[!question] Problem 8.3 Stingy SAT
>Stingy SAT: Given a [[Boolean function|boolean function]] $f$ that is in [[Conjunctive normal form (CNF)|CNF]] and an integer $k$, find a satisfying assignment for $f$ with at most $k$ variables are true if it exists. 
>Prove that the stingy SAT problem is [[NP-Complete]].



>[!question] Problem 8.4 Clique-3
>Suppose we reduce the [[Max clique problem (graph)|Max clique problem]] but on [[Graph|graphs]] with [[Degree (graph)|degree]] at most 3.
>a) Probe that Clique-3 is in [[Nondeterministic Polynomial time (NP)|NP]].
>...
>d) Describe an $O(\vert V \vert^4)$ algorithm for clique-3.



>[!question] Problem 8.8 Exact 4-SAT
>Exact 4-SAT: Suppose we are given a [[Boolean function|boolean function]] $f$ that is in [[Conjunctive normal form (CNF)|CNF]], each clause has exactly 4 literals, and each variable appears at most once in each clause. The goal is to find a satisfying assignment, if one exists.
>Prove that Exact 4-SAT is [[NP-Complete|NP-complete]]. 



>[!question] Problem 8.10 Subgraph isomorphism
>



>[!question] 8.14 Clique + Independent set (HW 6 assessed)

>[!question] 8.19 Kite
