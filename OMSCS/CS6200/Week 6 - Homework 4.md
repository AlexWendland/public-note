From [Algorithms](http://algorithmics.lsi.upc.edu/docs/Dasgupta-Papadimitriou-Vazirani.pdf) by S. Dasgupta, C. Papadimitriou, and U. Vazirani.

> [!question] Problem 3.3 Topological ordering example
> Run the [[Depth-first search (DFS)|DFS]]-based [[Topological sorting (DAG)|topologically sort]] algorithm on the following graph. Whenever you have a choice of vertices to explore always pick the one that is alphabetically first.
> 1. Indicate the pre and post numbers of the nodes
> 2. What are the source and sinks of the graph?
> 3. What is the topologicla ordering found by the algorithm?
> 4. How many topological orderings does this graph have?

>[!question] Problem 3.4 SCC algorithm example
>Run the [[Strongly connected components (directed graphs)|strongly connected components]] algorithm on the following directed graphs $G$. When doing [[Depth-first search (DFS)|DFS]] on $G^R$: whenever there is a choice of vertices to explore, always pick the one that is alphabetically first. 
>In each case answer the following questions:
>1. In what order are the strongly connected components found?
>2. Which are the source SCCs and which are the sing SCCs?
>3. Draw the metagraph.
>4. What is the minimum number of edges you must add to this graph to make it strongly connected?

>[!question] Problem 3.5 Reverse of graphs
>The [[Reverse directed graph|reverse]] of a [[Directed graph|directed graph]] $G = (V,E)$ is another directed graph $G^R = (V, E^R)$ on the same vertex set, but with all edges revered; that is $E^R = \{(v,u) \vert (u,v \in E\}$.
>Give a linear-time algorithm for computing the reverse of a graph in [[Adjacency list format (graph)]] format?
