# Week 10 - NP-complete overview

## Complexity classes

![[Nondeterministic Polynomial time (NP)]]

In this class we use the [[Search problems|search problem]] definition.

![[Search problems]]

Note here we have.

![[Polynomial time is a subset of NP-complete#Statement]]

There is an open problem.

![[P equals NP or P not equals NP#P equals NP or P not equals NP]]

## Satisfiability

![[Satisfiability problem (SAT problem)#Statement|SAT problem]]

![[The Satisfiability problem is in NP]]

## k-colourings problem

![[k-colourings problem (graphs)#Statement]]

![[The k-colourings problem is in NP]]

## [[Minimum Spanning Tree problem (MST)|MST]]

![[Minimum Spanning Tree problem (MST)#Statement|MST]]

![[Minimum Spanning Tree problem is in NP]]

This proof was relatively easy as [[Minimum Spanning Tree problem (MST)|MST]] is a [[Polynomial time|polynomial time]] problem.
