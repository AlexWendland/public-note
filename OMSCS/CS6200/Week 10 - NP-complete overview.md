# Week 10 - NP-complete overview

## Complexity classes

![[Nondeterministic Polynomial time (NP)]]

In this class we use the [[Search problems|search problem]] definition.

![[Search problems]]

Note here we have.

![[Polynomial time is a subset of NP-complete#Statement]]

There is an open problem.

![[P equals NP or P not equals NP#P equals NP or P not equals NP]]

## Satisfiability
