# Week 10 - NP-complete overview

## Complexity classes

![[Nondeterministic Polynomial time (NP)]]

In this class we use the [[Search problems|search problem]] definition.

![[Search problems]]

Note here we have.

![[Polynomial time is a subset of NP-complete#Statement]]

There is an open problem.

![[P equals NP or P not equals NP#P equals NP or P not equals NP]]

## Satisfiability

![[Satisfiability problem (SAT problem)|SAT problem]]

We will show this problem is in [[Nondeterministic Polynomial time (NP)|NP]].

First note that it is in the form of a [[Search problems|search problem]] as it either provides you with a satisfying assignment to the $n$ variables or says one doesn't exist.
