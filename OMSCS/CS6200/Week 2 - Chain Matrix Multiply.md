# Week 2 - Chain Matrix Multiply

The goal is this problem is, given a number of [[Matrix|matrices]] what is the most efficient way to multiply them together?

Lets say we have [[Matrix|matrices]] $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ and they have different sizes such that we can multiply $A B C D$. Whilst matrix multiplication might be [[Associativity|associative]] there might be a more efficient way to multiply them together!

## Cost of multiplying two matrices

Lets say with have two [[Matrix|matrices]] $W$ (of size $a \times b$) and $Y$ (of size $b \times c$) we set their product to be $Z = WY$ (of size $a \times c$). To calculate a single entry in $Z$ we need to multiply a row of $W$ (of size $b$) with a column of $Y$ (of size $b$)
$$ z_{ij} = \sum_{k = 1}^b w_{ik} \ y_{kj}$$
which takes $b$ multiplications and $b-1$ additions. As $Z$ has size $a \times c$ this involves $abc$ multiplications and $a(b-1)c$ additions.

Here the multiplications are the more costly operations so this is what we will focus on for the cost of this single operation.

## Dynamic program set up

Let $C(i,j)$ with $1 \leq i \leq j \leq n$ be the minimum cost of multiplying $A_i A_{i+1} \ldots A_j$.

The solution to the problem will be $C(1,n)$.

The base case will be $C(i,i) = 0$.

The [[Recursion|recursion]] step will be
$$ C(i,j) = \min\{C(i,k) + C(k,j) + m_im_km_j \vert i < k < j\}.$$

To calculate $C(i,j)$ we need to [[Iterative algorithms|iteratively]] increase the difference between $j - i$, the base case is $0$ the last case will be $n-1$.

        if column > self._matrix_size:
            raise ValueError("Column must be less than matrix size")

        self._number_of_matrices = len(sizes) - 1

    def _fill_matrix_diagonally(self) -> None:

                upper_index = lower_index + difference
                self._solution_array.set(
                    lower_index,
                    upper_index,

    def _solve_for_single_value(

                + self._solution_array.get(split_index + 1, upper_index)

                )
                for split_index in range(lower_index, upper_index)
            ]
        )

    def _get_cost_of_multiplying_matrices(
        self, left_index: int, middle_index: int, right_index: int
    ) -> int:
        return (
            self._sizes[left_index - 1]
            * self._sizes[middle_index]
            * self._sizes[right_index]
        )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    sizes = [5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 10, 5]
    solver = ChainMultiplySolver()
    print(solver.solve(sizes))
```

Lets look at the run time of this algorithm, let the number of sizes be $n$. First `_setup_problem` takes $O(n^2)$ as we have to fill half a matrix.

Working inside out, `_get_cost_of_multiplying_matrices` takes $O(1)$.  Then `_solve_for_single_value` calls `_get_cost_of_multiplying_matrices` up to $n$ times so takes $O(n)$. Lastly `_fill_matrix_diagonally` has two for loops calling `_solve_for_single_value` up to $n$ times each giving the run time of `_fill_matrix_diagonally` to be $O(n^3)$.

So the cost of running `solve` $O(n^2) + O(n^3) = O(n^3)$.

## Tips

- First find a solution using substrings.
- Then consider if substrings was necessary, could you use prefixes?
