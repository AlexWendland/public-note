# Week 10 - Graph problem complexity

## Independent set

![[Independent set (graph)|independent set]]

Therefore we have the following problem.
![[Max independent set problem (graph)#Statement]]

Though this problem is not known to be in [[Nondeterministic Polynomial time (NP)|NP]] as to verify if a set is the largest set we would require to calculate the set of largest size. However, we can edit this question to make one that is in [[Nondeterministic Polynomial time (NP)|NP]].
![[Independent set of a given size#Statement]]

![[Independent set of a given size is in NP]]

More over we have it is [[NP-Complete]].
