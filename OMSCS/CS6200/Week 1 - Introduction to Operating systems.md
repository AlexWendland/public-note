![[Operating system (OS)]]

## Metaphor

The [[Operating system (OS)|OS]] is a lot like a toyshop manager. They are required to:

- Direct the operational resources
	- Controls use of employees time,
	- Distribute tools and parts between workers
- Enforces working policies
	- Ensures fairness between workers,
	- Make sure toys are made safely,
	- How to cleans-up after the job has been completed.
- Mitigates difficulty of complex tasks
	- Simplifies operations for each worker to do,
	- Chooses optimal task allocation to improve performance.

In comparison an [[Operating system (OS)|OS]] does the following:

- Direct the operational resources
	- Controls the use of CPU and memory,
	- Controls the use of peripheral devices.
- Enforces working policies
	- Can ensure fair use of the resources between different processes,
	- Limit resources a certain process has access to.
- Mitigates difficulty of complex tasks
	- Abstracts hardware (system calls).
