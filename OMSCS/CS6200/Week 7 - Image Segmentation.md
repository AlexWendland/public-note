# Week 7 - Image Segmentation

Given an image, we would like to separate it into its distinct components. Such as the subject and background.


## Formulation

Suppose we have picture $P$ which is a grid of different pixels. Define a [[Graph|undirected graph]] $G = (V, E)$ where $V$ is the set of pixels and $E$ is neighbouring pixels. Suppose in addition we are provided:

- $f(v)$ is the likelihood $v \in V$ is in the foreground (assume $f(v) \geq 0$),
- $b(v)$ is the likelihood $v \in V$ is in the background (assume $b(v) \geq 0$), and
- $p(u,v)$ is the separation penalty for separating $u,v \in V$ for $(u,v) \in E$ (assume $p(u,v) \geq 0$).

Then for any [[Cut (graph)|cut]] of $V$ into $V = F \cup B$, foreground and background, we define a weight:
$$w(F,B) = \sum_{v \in F} f(v) + \sum_{u \in B} b(u) - \sum_{(v,u) \in cut(F,B)} p(u,v).$$
The goal is to find the [[Cut (graph)|cut]] of $V$ with maximum weight.

## Reformulation

Right now we have two problems, it is a maximalisation problem and the weights might not be non-negative.

Let
$$L = \sum_{v \in V} f(v) + b(v).$$
Then we can reformulate
$$\begin{align*}w(F,B) & = \sum_{v \in F} f(v) + \sum_{u \in B} b(u) - \sum_{(v,u) \in cut(F,B)} p(u,v)\\
& = L - \sum_{u \in B} f(u) - \sum_{v \in F} b(v) - \sum_{(v,u) \in cut(F,B)} p(u,v)\end{align*}$$
Therefore to maximise $w(F,B)$ we could instead minimise
$$w'(F,B) = \sum_{u \in B} f(u) + \sum_{v \in F} b(v) + \sum_{(v,u) \in cut(F,B)} p(u,v).$$

>$$w'(F,B) = \sum_{u \in B} f(u) + \sum_{v \in F} b(v) + \sum_{(v,u) \in cut(F,B)} p(u,v).$$

## Making a flow network

Define directed graph $G' = (V', E')$ where $V' = V \cup \{s,t\}$ and
$$E' = \{ (u,v), (v,u), (s,x), (x,t) \vert (u,v) \in E, x \in V \}.$$
Where we define capacity
$$c(u,v) = \begin{cases} p(u,v) & \mbox{if } (u,v) \in E\\ f(v) & \mbox{if } u = s\\ b(u) & \mbox{if } v = t\\ \end{cases}.$$
To give [[Flow network|flow network]] $(G', c, s, t)$.

Note a [[Min st-cut problem|min st-cut]] of this graph relates to a solution to the altered problem.  The solution is some cut $(F \cup \{s\}, B \cup \{t\})$ with minimum capacity:
$$\begin{align*} capacity(F \cup \{s\}, B \cup \{t\}) & = \sum_{\substack{(v,w) \in E'\\ v \in F \cup \{s\}, w \in B \cup \{t\}}} c(v,w)\\
& = \sum_{u \in B} c(s, u) + \sum_{v \in F} c(v,t) + \sum_{\substack{(v,w) \in E\\ v \in F, w \in B}} c(v,w)\\
& = \sum_{u \in B} f(u) + \sum_{v \in F} b(v) + \sum_{\substack{(v,w) \in E\\ v \in F, w \in B}} p(v,w)\\
& = w'(F,B).
\end{align*}$$
## Algorithm

### pseudocode

```pseudocode
Image_segmentation(G,f,b,p):
	Input: Image segmentation problem defined by G, f, b, p.
	Output: Maximum value image segmentation.
1. Define flow network (G', c, s, t) as above.
2. Solve the flow network problem F U {s}, B U {t}
3. return F, b.
```

### Runtime

Defining the graph takes at most $O(\vert V \vert + \vert E \vert)$ so the algorithm is dominated by the solution to your flow network problem.
