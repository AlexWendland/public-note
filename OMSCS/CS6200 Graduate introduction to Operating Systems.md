# CS6215 Graduate introduction to Operating Systems

This is a graduate-level introductory course in operating systems. This course teaches the basic operating system abstractions, mechanisms, and their implementations. The core of the course focuses on OS support for concurrency (threads) and synchronisation, resource management (CPU, memory, I/O), and distributed services. The practical component of the course teaches multi-thread programming, inter-process communication, and distributed interactions via RPC.
