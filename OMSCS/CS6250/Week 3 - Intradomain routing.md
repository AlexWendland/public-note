## Intradomain routing

Here are two main algorithms, these use two different approaches to how route [[Packets|packets]].

![[Link-state routing algorithms]]

![[Distance vector routing algorithms]]

![[Count to infinity problem]]

![[Routing Information Protocol (RIP)]]

![[Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)|OSPF]]

When using [[Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)|OSPF]] the computation is handled by the [[Router|router]] processor as apposed to the [[Switching fabric|switching fabric]] which handles message forwarding.

The process the router goes through is:
1. Collect [[Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)|LSA]]'s from other routers.
2. Use [[Dijkstra's algorithm]] to calculate new shortest paths and update [[Forwarding information base (FIB)]]
3. Forward messages using the [[Switching fabric|switching fabric]]

This can be summarised by the following flow chart.

## Traffic Engineering

The process of deciding the weights between [[Router|routers]] can be complicated as small changes in weights can have a large impact to the traffic flow. There is a framework for this.
