# Week 1 - Introduction

Here are some questions you should be able to answer to start the course:

• What are the advantages and disadvantages of a layered architecture?  
• What are the differences and similarities between the OSI model and the five-layered Internet  
model?  
• What are sockets?  
• Describe each layer of the OSI model.  
• Provide examples of popular protocols at each layer of the five-layered Internet model.  
• What is encapsulation, and how is it used in a layered model?  
• What is the end-to-end (e2e) principle?  
• What are the examples of a violation of e2e principle?  
• What is the EvoArch model?  
• Explain a round in the EvoArch model.  
• What are the ramifications of the hourglass shape of the internet?  
• Repeaters, hubs, bridges, and routers operate on which layers?  
• What is a bridge, and how does it “learn”?  
• What is a distributed algorithm?  
• Explain the Spanning Tree Algorithm.  
• What is the purpose of the Spanning Tree Algorithm?

## Why study computer networks

- Internet is a massive area of growth!
- Networks more generally play an influential role in society.
- Networking is used lots of cross disciplinary research and is cross cutting through computer science.
