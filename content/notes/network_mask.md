>[!tldr] Network mask
>A network mask is a mask that gets applied to an [IP address](internet_protocol_(ip).md). These are normally of the form  0.0.0.0 (empty mask), 255.0.0.0 (use the first 8 [bits](bit.md) of the address), 255.255.0.0 (first 16 [bits](bit.md)), 255.255.255.0 (first 24 [bits](bit.md)), or 255.255.255.255 to use the whole address.
