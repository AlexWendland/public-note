title: Find connected components in a undirected graph
type: problem
---
## Statement

> [!definition] Find [connected components](connected_components_(graph).md) in an [undirected graph](graph.md)
> Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ how can we find a mapping from it's vertices $V$ to the connected components of $G$.

## Solutions

- [DFS to find connected components in an undirected graph](dfs_to_find_connected_components_in_an_undirected_graph.md)
	- This runs in $O(\vert V \vert \cdot \vert E \vert)$ time.
