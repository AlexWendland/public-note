title: Arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean
type: lemma
---
# Statement

> [!lemma] Lemma
> For $w_1, \ldots, w_k \geq 0$ we have the [arithmetic mean](arithmetic_mean.md) is greater than or equal to the [geometric mean](geometric_mean.md). In otherwords
> $$\frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k w_i \geq \left ( \prod_{i=1}^k w_i \right )^{1/k}.$$

# Proof

All the proofs for this are really horrible ....
