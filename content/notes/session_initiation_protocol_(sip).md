title: Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
type: definition
---
> [!definition] Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
> This [protocol](protocol_(networks).md) handles the signalling used in [VoIP](voice_over_ip_(voip).md) applications. Signalling typically takes care of how calls are set up and torn down. This has four major responsibilities.
>
>	1. User location - the parties finding one another,
>	2. Session establishment - handling the callee accepting, rejecting or redirecting the call,
>	3. Session negotiation - endpoint synchronizing on the same standard,
>	4. Call participation management - handling people joining or leaving.
