# Signed integers

When storing [integers](integer.md) in a computer, you can do it with a 'sign' or without it. This essentially just means you designate one [bit](bit.md) at the start of the representation of that [integer](integer.md) which indicates it is either positive or negative number.

This means unsigned [integers](integer.md) can store larger numbers but can't become negative.
