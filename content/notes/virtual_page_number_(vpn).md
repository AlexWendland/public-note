>[!note] Virtual page number (VPN)
>When using [paging](paging_system.md) the [virtual memory](virtual_memory.md) is broken down into [pages](memory_page.md), each of which is indexed from 0 to the maximum memory that the [process](process.md) has. The *virtual page number* is the index of a particular [page](memory_page.md) in this address space. This, along with an offset into the page, determines the exact location of a [byte](byte.md) of data.
