title: Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)
type: definition
---
>[!note]
>Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) is a standard for connecting peripheral devices to a computer's [CPU](central_processing_unit_(cpu).md). It defines a bus that allows hardware components like network cards, sound cards, modems, and storage controllers to communicate with the CPU and memory. PCI supports plug-and-play configuration and allows multiple devices to share the same bus.
