>[!tldr] Reinforcement learning
>This is a branch of [Machine Learning](machine_learning.md) applied in a setting where a learner has a number of actions to take in a given state - each action will lead to a different reward and we want to maximise it. You are provided with previous [transitions](transitions_(mdp).md) and want to build a policy in the sense of a [Markov decision process](markov_decision_process.md).
