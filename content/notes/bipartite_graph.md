>[!definition] Bipartite graph
>A [graph](graph.md) ([directed graph](directed_graph.md) or [undirected graph](graph.md)) $G = (V,E)$ is *bipartite* if you can [partition](partition_(set).md) the vertex set $V = V_1 \cup V_2$ such that for all $(u,v) \in E$ we have $u \in V_1$ and $v \in V_2$ or vice versa.
