>[!definition] Rich clustering
>Suppose we are in the [clustering problem](clustering_problem.md) set up. A clustering algorithm $C$ is considered rich if for any assignment $f: T \rightarrow B$ there is a distance $d$ on $T$ such that the clustering algorithm will give you that assignment $C(d) = f$.
