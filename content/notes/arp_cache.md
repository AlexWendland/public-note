>[!definition] ARP Cache
>The ARP cache of a [node](node_(ipv6).md) in a [network](network.md) is a mapping from [IP addresses](internet_protocol_(ip).md) within the same [network](network.md) to their [MAC address](mac_address.md). A [node](node_(ipv6).md) can identify a [IP address](internet_protocol_(ip).md) within its [network](network.md) using the [network mask](network_mask.md). This gets updated using the [Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)](address_resolution_protocol_(arp).md).
