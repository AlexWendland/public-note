type: definition
---

This definition can mean multiple things.

>[!definition] Nondeterministic Polynomial time (search)
>The class of NP problems is the class of all [search problems](search_problems.md).

Otherwise it might mean.

>[!definition] Nondeterministic Polynomial time (decision)
>The class of NP problems is the class of all [decision problems](decision_problems.md).
