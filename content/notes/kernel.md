>[!tldr] Kernel
>The *kernel* is the core component of an [Operating system (OS)](operating_system_(os).md) that manages the system's hardware and resources, such as the [CPU](central_processing_unit_(cpu).md), [direct memory access](direct_memory_access_(dma).md), and [I/O](input_output_(io).md) devices. It acts as an intermediary between software applications and the physical hardware of a computer. The kernel is responsible for critical tasks, including process management, memory management, device management, and system security.
