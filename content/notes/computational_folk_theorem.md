# Statement

> [!lemma] Lemma
> For any 2-player [discounted reward](discounted_rewards.md) repeated game it is possible to build a Povlov-like machine with is [Subgame perfect](subgame_perfect.md) and can achieve [Nash equilibrium](nash_equilibrium.md) in polynomial time. This is done in one of three ways
> - Pavlov if it is possible,
> - Make it [zero-sum](zero-sum_game.md) (like) and solve using a [linear programme](linear_programme.md), or
> - at most one player can improve.

# Proof
