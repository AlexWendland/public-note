title: Traffic Scrubbing Service
type: definition
---
> [!definition] Traffic Scrubbing Services
> A scrubbing service diverts the incoming traffic to a specialised server, where the traffic is "scrubbed" into either clean or unwanted traffic. The clean traffic is then sent to its original destination. This offers fine-grained filtering but at a high monetary and bandwidth cost.
