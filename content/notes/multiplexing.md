>[!tldr] Multiplexing
>Multiplexing is the process by which multiple applications on the same [host](host_(networks).md) communicate with different hosts at the same time. Multiplexing gaurentees each application only gets the messages related to communications they have made. This is done by the use of [ports](port.md) - an additional address system on top of [IP addresses](internet_protocol_(ipv4).md).

>There are two types of multiplexing, connection orientated multiplexing and connection-less multiplexing. Connection here refers to an agreed way to and stop a communication.
