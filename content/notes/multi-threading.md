>[!note] Multi-threading
> This is the technique of breaking a complicated task up over multiple [threads](thread.md). They will still share the same [virtual memory](virtual_memory.md) and be tied to the same [process](process.md) but can be executed in parallel if scheduled on different kernel threads.
