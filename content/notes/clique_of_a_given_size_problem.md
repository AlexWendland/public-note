# Statement

>[!definition] Clique of a given size problem
>Given an [undirected graph](graph.md) $G = (V,E)$ and a positive integer $g > 0$. Does there exist a [clique](clique_(graph).md) of size at least $g$ if so what is it?

# Solutions

# Theory

- [Clique of a given size problem is in NP](clique_of_a_given_size_problem_is_in_np.md)
- [Clique of a given size problem is NP-complete](clique_of_a_given_size_problem_is_np-complete.md)
