>[!definition] Unicast
> A [frame](frame_(networks).md) is unicast if it has a particular [nodes](node_(ipv6).md) [Internet Protocol (IPv4)](internet_protocol_(ipv4).md) and [MAC address](mac_address.md) within it. This is the normal way to message [nodes](node_(ipv6).md) when not using a [broadcast](broadcast_(networks).md).
