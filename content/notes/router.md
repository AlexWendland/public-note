>[!definition] Routers
> A router is any device that implements [Routing](routing.md).  They provide a traffic control point between [networks](network.md). This is a good place to apply security filtering or redirecting. A router will have an [Internet Protocol (IPv4)](internet_protocol_(ipv4).md) on each [network](network.md) it is connected to which will be its [Gateway](gateway.md) on that [network](network.md).
