> [!note] Programmed IO (PIO)
> This is a method of IO access that the [OS](operating_system_(os).md) can use without additional hardware support. The [CPU](central_processing_unit_(cpu).md) communicates directly with the device by writing to its command or data registers and introspects about the device's state through its status register.
