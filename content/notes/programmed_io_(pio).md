>[!tldr] Programmed IO (PIO)
>This is a method of IO access that the [OS](operating_system_(os).md) can use without an additional hardware support. The [CPU](central_processing_unit_(cpu).md) communicates directly with the device by writing to its command or data registers and introspects about the devices state through its status register.
