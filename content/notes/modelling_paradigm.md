>[!definition] Modelling paradigm
>In the [modelling framework](modelling_framework.md), normally the space of all function $f: A \rightarrow B \in Func(A,B)$ is much too large. Therefore we choose some *modelling paradigm* $M \subset Func(A,B)$ to pick our candidates from. For example, in [linear regression](linear_regression.md), we choose to pick [linear functions](linear_function.md) is some predefined set of inputs.
