>[!definition] Separation of concerns (SoC)
>Separation of concerns (SoC) in software engineering is a design principle that advocates dividing a computer program into distinct and independent modules or sections, each addressing a specific concern or aspect of functionality. The goal is to enhance the modularity, maintainability, and comprehensibility of the code by isolating different responsibilities.
>
>By separating concerns, changes or updates to one part of the system are less likely to affect other parts, making the software more flexible and easier to develop, understand, and maintain. Common examples of separated concerns include a clear distinction between user interface, business logic, and data storage in a software application. This principle is closely related to other design principles like modularity and abstraction.
