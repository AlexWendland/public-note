>[!tldr] Supervised learning
>In *supervised learning* we are given an input [domain](function_domain.md) $A$ and an output [codomain](function_codomain.md) $B$ with some observations $O \subset A \times B$ of a function $f^{\ast} : A \rightarrow B$. The goal is to approximate $f^{\ast}$ the best we can given these observations.
