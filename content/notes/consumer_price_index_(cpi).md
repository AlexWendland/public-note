The [Consumer Price Index (CPI)](consumer_price_index_(cpi).md) is the government backed measure of inflation in the [United Kingdom (UK)](united_kingdom_(uk).md). It is calculated monthly by the [Bank of England](bank_of_england.md). In the middle of the month the [Bank of England](bank_of_england.md) collects the prices of 700 different items from 120,000 different retail outlets. Then it uses these to establish the cost of these product. (*It was not clear to me which average was used here.*) Then they take a weighted (by average use) [Geometric mean](geometric_mean.md) of these prices to see the cost of living. ("The [Geometric mean](geometric_mean.md) was used instead of the [Arithmetic mean](arithmetic_mean.md) to exaggerate items at the lowest levels." *Don't really understand what they mean by this.*) This is normalised by that cost of the basket at the beginning of the index.
