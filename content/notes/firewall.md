>[!tldr] Firewall
> A firewall introspects [Packets](packets.md) entering a network and filters [packets](packets.md) out that are selected as malicious or unnecessary.
> This violates the [End to end principle](end_to_end_principle.md) as introspection on the packets happens before they get to their destination. This is seen as needed to protect hosts and [network](network.md) integrity.
