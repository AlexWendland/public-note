>[!tldr] Interdomain routing
>This is the process of [routing](routing.md) between [Autonomous system (AS)](autonomous_system_(as).md). Here there is a lot of commercial pressure on the decision of which routes to offer. The [protocols](protocol_(networks).md) that are used for this are called [Boarder gateway protocol (BGP)](boarder_gateway_protocol_(bgp).md).
