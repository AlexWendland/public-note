>[!note] Context switch
>A *context switch* is when the [CPU](central_processing_unit_(cpu).md) goes from running one [process](process.md) to running a different one. This involves writing the old [process](process.md)'s [PCB](process_control_block_(pcb).md) into memory and fetching the second process's [PCB](process_control_block_(pcb).md) from memory and loading it into the [CPU registers](cpu_register.md).
