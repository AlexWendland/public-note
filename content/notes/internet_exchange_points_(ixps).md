>[!definition] Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)
>These are massive interchanges for different internet providers such as [ISPs](internet_service_provider_(isp).md) and [CDNs](content_delivery_network_(cdn).md). These can exchange traffic locally in a commercial model that promotes more open transfer of traffic.
