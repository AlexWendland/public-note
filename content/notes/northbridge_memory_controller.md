title: Northbridge Memory Controller
type: definition
---
>[!tldr] Northbridge Memory Controller
>The *northbridge memory controller* is a form of [memory controller](memory_controller.md) which is used in older architectures. The [memory controller](memory_controller.md) was located on the Northbridge chipset (separate from the [CPU](central_processing_unit_(cpu).md)). This design introduced latency since memory requests had to travel through the Northbridge before reaching [RAM](random_access_memory_(ram).md).
