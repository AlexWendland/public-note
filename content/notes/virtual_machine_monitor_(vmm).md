>[!note] Virtual machine monitor (VMM)
>A virtual machine monitor enables [virtualization](virtualization.md) by providing an environment:
>1. *Fidelity*: essentially identical with the original machine.
>2. *Performance*: where programs show at worst only minor decrease in speed.
>3. *Safety and isolation*: where the VMM is in complete control of the system resources.
