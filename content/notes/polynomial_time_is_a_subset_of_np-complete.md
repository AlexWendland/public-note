title: Polynomial time is a subset of NP-complete
type: lemma
---
# Statement

>[!important] Lemma
>The class of [Polynomial time](polynomial_time.md) problems is a subset of [Nondeterministic Polynomial time (NP)](nondeterministic_polynomial_time_(np).md).

# Proof

If the problem is in [NP](nondeterministic_polynomial_time_(np).md) then we already know the problem is a [search problem](search_problems.md). Therefore it is in the class [Nondeterministic Polynomial time](nondeterministic_polynomial_time_(np).md).
