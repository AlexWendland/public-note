title: Strongly connected components (directed graphs)
type: definition
---
> [!definition] Strongly connected components
> Let $G = (V,E)$ be a [directed graph](directed_graph.md). We say $C \subset V$ is a *strongly connected component* if all vertices $x,y \in C$ are [strongly connected](strongly_connected_(directed_graphs).md) and $C$ is maximal with this property.
