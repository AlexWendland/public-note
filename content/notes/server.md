>[!tldr] Server
> A Server can have multiple definitions in the context of networks. Most broadly it is just a [Host (networks)](host_(networks).md) that implements an Application that can server requests. However, in the context of a transaction it is simply the [Host (networks)](host_(networks).md) that is sending data.
