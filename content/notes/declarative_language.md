title: Declarative Language
type: definition

This is a language that specifies the desired end state. So it is the picture on the front of the Ikea manual rather than the instruction manual!

 Examples
- [Markdown](markdown.md)
- [Markup Language](markup_language.md)

 Thoughts
A good [User Interface (UI)](user_interface_(ui).md) should be declarative with the system behind the scenes doing the leg work to get to that state. This paradigm is being applied more and more within [DevOps](devops.md) for example [Kubernetes](kubernetes.md) and [Terraform](terraform.md) both you specify the end state and the program sorts altering the current state to match this.
