>[!definition] Portable operating system interface (POSIX)
>*Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)* is a set of standardised APIs and interfaces that define how software should interact with an [operating system](operating_system_(os).md). POSIX ensures compatibility and portability of applications across different UNIX-like operating systems by standardising system calls, command-line interfaces, and utility functions. It is widely used to maintain cross-platform compatibility in software development.
