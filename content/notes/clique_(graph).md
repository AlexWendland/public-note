>[!definition] Clique (graph)
>In an [undirected graph](graph.md) $G = (V,E)$ a set of vertices $C \subset V$ is a clique if the [induced subgraph](induced_subgraph.md) on $C$ is the [complete graph](complete_graph.md) on $C$. (i.e. $\{(c,c') \vert \ c, c' \in C \mbox{ with } c \not = c'\} \subset E$.)
