> [!note] Memory page
> A _memory page_ is a fixed-size block of memory, determined by the operating system and hardware architecture, typically at system startup. It serves as the fundamental unit of memory management in both [physical memory](physical_memory.md) and [virtual memory](virtual_memory.md). The operating system, in conjunction with the [Memory Management Unit (MMU)](memory_management_unit_(mmu).md), manages this mapping through the use of [page tables](page_table.md) to [memory frames](memory_frame.md).
