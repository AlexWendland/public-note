>[!tldr] Weakly relevant feature
>For a learning problem a feature $x_i$ of the input space is *weakly relevant* if
>- it is not a [Strongly relevant feature](strongly_relevant_feature.md), and
>- there exists a subset of features $S$ such that adding $x_i$ to $S$ improves the [Bayeses optimal classifier](bayeses_optimal_classifier.md).
