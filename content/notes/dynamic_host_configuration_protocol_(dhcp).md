> [!definition] Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
> To connect to the internet you need 4 pieces of information:
> - Your [Internet Protocol (IPv4)](internet_protocol_(ipv4).md),
> - Your [network mask](network_mask.md),
> - The [default gateway](default_gateway.md) of your local network, and
> - The [Domain Name System (DNS)](domain_name_system_(dns).md) server you will use.
>
> DHCP provides you with all the above information once you connect to a new network. When you first join a network, you send a DHCP discover message and receive all your configuration information.
