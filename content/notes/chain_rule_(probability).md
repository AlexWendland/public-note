>[!tldr] Chain rule (probability)
>For [random variables](random_variable.md) $A_i$ for $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ we have
>$$\mathbb{P}[A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_k] = \prod_{k=1}^n \mathbb{P}[A_k \vert A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_{k-1}].$$
>This follows from the definition of [conditional probability](conditional_probability.md).
