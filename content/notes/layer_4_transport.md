>[!tldr] Layer 4 Transport
>This layer is responsible for getting the data to the right application once we are on the [host](host_(networks).md). It attaches a layer 4 header with the destination and source [port](port.md). There are two different types of [ports](port.md).
>- 0-65535 [TCP](transmission_control_protocol_(tcp).md), which favours reliability, or
>- 0-65535 [UDP](user_datagram_protocol_(udp).md), which favours efficiency.
