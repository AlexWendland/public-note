title: Vertex cover of a given size
type: problem
---
# Statement

>[!definition] Vertex cover of a given size
>Given an [undirected graph](graph.md) $G = (V,E)$ and a positive integer $g > 0$, is there a [vertex cover](vertex_cover.md) using at most $g$ vertices, if so what is it?

# Solutions

# Theory

- [Vertex cover of a given size is NP](vertex_cover_of_a_given_size_is_np.md)
- [Vertex cover of a given size is NP-complete](vertex_cover_of_a_given_size_is_np-complete.md)

# Related problems
