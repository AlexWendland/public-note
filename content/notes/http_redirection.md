> [!tldr] HTTP redirection
> This is a response in the [HTTP](hypertext_transfer_protocol_(http).md) [protocol](protocol_(networks).md). If a client sends a GET request to a server for a particular resource, the server can respond with a 3xx code and the name of the new server to retrieve the resource from. This causes the client to go to another domain to retrieve that asset.
