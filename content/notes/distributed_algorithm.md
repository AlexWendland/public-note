>[!definition] Distributed algorithm
> A distributed algorithm is a method used to solve a computational problem across multiple interconnected processors or nodes that communicate and coordinate with each other through message passing. Unlike centralized algorithms, which operate on a single processor, distributed algorithms function in environments where data and computational tasks are distributed among various locations, often without a central authority.
