> [!definition] Device driver
> A device driver is a piece of software installed in the [OS](operating_system_(os).md) to enable the operating system to communicate with an external device. The operating system offers a standard API for device drivers to conform to. Many devices comply with standard drivers, but if the device is specialised, they are offered by the device manufacturer.
