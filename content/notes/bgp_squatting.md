title: BGP squatting
type: definition
---
> [!definition] BGP squatting
> This is a form of [BGP Hijacking](bgp_hijacking.md) where the attacking [AS](autonomous_system_(as).md) announces a prefix before the genuine [AS](autonomous_system_(as).md) does - thus becoming the de facto route. This disrupts the flow of traffic to the intended [AS](autonomous_system_(as).md).
