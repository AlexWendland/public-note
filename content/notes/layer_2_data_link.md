>[!tldr] Layer 2 Data Link
>Layer 2 of the [OSI model](open_systems_interconnection_(osi)_model.md) concerns itself with [MAC addresses](mac_address.md) and within [network](network.md) communication. It will have a header that stores the source and destination [MAC address](mac_address.md) of the current hop within a [network](network.md). These are tools that put data on or off the [Physical layer](layer_1_physical.md). For example:
>- [Network Interface Cards (NIC)](network_interface_cards_(nic).md),
>- Wifi access cards, or
>- [Switches](switch.md).
>
>These devices all have unique [MAC address](mac_address.md).
