title: Fast API
type: library
---

This is a [python](python_index.md) library to implement an [API](application_programming_interface_(api).md). Whilst there are other [API](api.md) implementations in python such as [Flask](flask.md) the unique selling point of Fast API is it's speed.

Similarly to [Flask](flask.md) this is implemented mainly by using [decorators](decorators.md) to wrap functions to turn them into end points.
