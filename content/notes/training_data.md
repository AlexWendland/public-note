> [!definition] Training data
> Within the [modelling framework](modelling_framework.md), *training data* is a set of observations $T \subset A \times B$ which are normally samples from $X$ and $Y$. You would use this to train models. This should be kept distinct from your [testing data](testing_data.md).
