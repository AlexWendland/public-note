> [!definition] Routing table
> Routers keep a table of where packets with [IP addresses](internet_protocol_(ipv4).md) belong to which connection for redirecting messages. This table maps the tuple of an [Internet Protocol (IPv4)](internet_protocol_(ipv4).md) address and a [network mask](network_mask.md) to either an interface or a next-hop gateway. You can use [Route summarization](route_summarization.md) to keep a routing table short.
