>[!tldr] Stationary distribution
>For a [Markov chain](markov_chain.md) given by $P \in M_{N, N}(\mathbb{R})$, a *station distribution* is a [probability distribution](probability_distribution.md) given by a vector $\pi \in M_{1,N}(\mathbb{R})$  (this is also a [probability matrix](stochastic_matrix.md)) such that
>$$\pi P = \pi.$$
