> [!note] Fragmentation
> _Fragmentation_ occurs when memory is inefficiently utilised due to gaps or wasted space. It can take two forms:
> - [Internal fragmentation](internal_fragmentation.md) happens when allocated memory blocks are larger than needed, leaving unused space inside them.
> - [External fragmentation](external_fragmentation.md) happens when free memory is split into non-contiguous blocks, preventing the allocation of a large contiguous region despite sufficient total free space.
