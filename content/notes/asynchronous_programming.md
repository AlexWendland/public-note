> [!definition] Asynchronous programming
>Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows a program to handle operations that may take an indeterminate amount of time, such as [I/O](input_output_(io).md)-bound tasks, without blocking the execution of the entire program. Instead of waiting for an operation to complete before moving on to the next one, asynchronous programming enables a program to initiate an operation and then continue executing other tasks while waiting for the operation to finish. Once the operation completes, the program is notified, and the relevant code can be executed.
