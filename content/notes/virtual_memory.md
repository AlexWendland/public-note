>[!note] Virtual memory
> So [processes](process.md) do not have to be aware of one another when accessing [RAM](random_access_memory_(ram).md) they do it through *virtual memory*. This is a simplified address space which is then mapped onto [physical memory](physical_memory.md) by the [Memory Management Unit (MMU)](memory_management_unit_(mmu).md). Processes access the virtual memory through the *virtual address space*.
