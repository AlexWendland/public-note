>[!note] Address space (OS)
>For a [process](process.md) the address space is the [virtual memory](virtual_memory.md) associated to the executing program. This is used to make memory management within the program simple and abstracts handling the [physical memory](physical_memory.md) to the [OS](operating_system_(os).md).
