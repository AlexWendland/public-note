title: Depth-first search (DFS)
type: algorithm
---

This is a way of traversing a [graph](graph.md) (could be a [directed graph](directed_graph.md) or [undirected graph](graph.md)). It explores all the way down one branch of the graph before tracing and exploring other branches.

The generally runs in $O(\vert V \vert + \vert E \vert)$ time.

# Examples

- [DFS to find connected components in an undirected graph](dfs_to_find_connected_components_in_an_undirected_graph.md)
- [DFS to find path in a directed graph](dfs_to_find_path_in_a_directed_graph.md)
- [DFS to find path in an undirected graph](dfs_to_find_path_in_an_undirected_graph.md)
