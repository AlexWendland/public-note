>[!note] Cache
>A cache is a method used to speed up data retrieval. It stores data being accessed in a faster type of memory or a closer location to the [CPU](central_processing_unit_(cpu).md). If the data is not present in the cache, it is loaded from somewhere else into the cache. This is called a *cache miss* and normally results in a costly action.
