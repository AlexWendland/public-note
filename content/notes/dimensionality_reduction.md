>[!definition] Dimensionality reduction
> Suppose we are in the [modelling framework](modelling_framework.md). Dimensionality reduction is the process of taking our input space $A$ and reducing the number of features within it. It consists of a map $p: \mathbb{F}^N \rightarrow \mathbb{F}^M$ where you usually want $M < N$.
