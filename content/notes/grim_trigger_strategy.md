> [!definition] Grim trigger strategy
> Given we have some agreed cooperation strategy $C$ and a strategy that guarantees the [minmax profile](minmax_profile.md) for the other player $P$, the *grim trigger strategy* is as follows: as long as the other player is following strategy $C$, we follow strategy $C$ too—if they ever do not follow strategy $C$, we switch to strategy $P$ for the rest of time.
