## Overview

During my time on the [Science and Engineering Faststream](https://www.faststream.gov.uk/science-engineering/index.html), a three-year leadership program, I was assigned to the Home Office on the [Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/advisory-council-on-the-misuse-of-drugs).

## Key achievements

**Policy development**
- Worked closely with the council to deliver key advice to the government on regulations concerning [commercial CBD products](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/acmd-advice-on-consumer-cannabidiol-cbd-products)
- Addressed [research barriers caused by regulations on Synthetic Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists (SCRA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consideration-of-barriers-to-research-part-1)
- Drafted advice to the Prime Minister and Home Secretary about a constitutional crisis at the ACMD

**Community and organisational development**
- Developed a "coffee roulette" application to enhance connectivity within my Faststream cohort
- Conducted thorough analysis of Pulse Survey results to help guide departmental responses to COVID-19
- Fostered a closer, more supportive Faststream community

## Impact

These efforts contributed to ACMD's continued operations, informed government research strategies, and fostered a closer, more supportive Faststream community.
