type: lecture
week: 7

This algorithm is essentially the same as [Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm](../../notes/ford-fulkerson_algorithm.md) but we use [BFS](breath-first_search_(bfs).md) instead of [DFS](../../notes/depth-first_search_(dfs).md) to find the augmenting path in the [residual network](../../notes/residual_network_(flow).md).
