# Markup Language

A [[Markup Language]] is text-encoding system that tells the computer how to display some text. There are 3 main categories
- **Presentational markup** - ironically the least well presented of all of them. Essentially binary code that is interpreted for programs such as Word.
- **Procedural markup** - This uses tags within the language to define how it should be rendered. Such as [[Markdown]] and [[Tex]].
- **Descriptive markup** - (Sometimes called semantic) This defines how to label sections of the text. Such as [[Latex]] and [[HTML]]. 

# Difference from a [[Programming Language]]

A [[Markup Language]] is a [[Declarative Language]] instead of a [[Programming Language]] which is an [[Imperative Language]]. This means is specifies an end state rather than a sequence of instructions to get there
