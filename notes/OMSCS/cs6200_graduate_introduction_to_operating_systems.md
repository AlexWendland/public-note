# CS6200 Graduate introduction to Operating Systems

This is a graduate-level introductory course in operating systems. This course teaches the basic operating system abstractions, mechanisms, and their implementations. The core of the course focuses on OS support for concurrency (threads) and synchronisation, resource management (CPU, memory, I/O), and distributed services. The practical component of the course teaches multi-thread programming, inter-process communication, and distributed interactions via RPC.

>[!bug] Break
>I retook this course so there is a slight break in dates between lectures 4 and 5. The content was the same for both times I took it.
