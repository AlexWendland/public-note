Advanced Operating Systems is a graduate-level course that addresses a broad range of topics in operating system design and implementation, including:
- Operating system structuring
- Synchronization, communication and scheduling in parallel systems
- Distributed systems, their communication mechanisms, distributed objects and middleware
- Failures and recovery management
- System support for Internet-scale computing
By tracing the key ideas of today's most popular systems to their origins in research, the class highlights key developments in operating system design over the last two decades and illustrates how insight has evolved to implementation.
