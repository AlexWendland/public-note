# Introduction to statistical learning with Applications in Python

This is a book by multiple authors about [Machine Learning](../../general/machine_learning.md) I was reading with a bunch of my friends. You can find it in my [repo](islp_website.pdf.md) or for free on their [website](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLP/ISLP_website.pdf.download.html).
