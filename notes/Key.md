# Key

I am using obsidian callouts, which is a nice feature. I am trying to stay consistent but don't shoot me if I fail. I will use the following (this is mainly for me):

> [!tldr] Definition
> A definition of an object.

> [!example] Example
> Useful example of what is going on.

> [!important] Proposition
> Something that is deduced, normally with a proof below.

> [!note] Key point
> An important point to note.

> [!question] Exercise question
> A problem related to the material.

> [!attention] Warning
> Something to be wary of, most probably because I misunderstood something before.
