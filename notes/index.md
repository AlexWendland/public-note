# Welcome!

This is very much an experiment. The purpose of this is to just [start writing stuff](wendland_weekly_index.md) ... about all the things I like. So I have a database I am building up. Mainly for my quick reference and for the information to be presented in an [Alex Wendland](alex_wendland.md) friendly way!

So some things I am interested in to start:
- [Data](data.md)
- [Programming Index](programming_index.md)
- [DevOps](devops.md)
- [Maths Index](maths_index.md)
- [Politics](politics.md)
- [Philosophy](philosophy.md)

I also like other things but don't think they really belong here, this is mainly for technical stuff.

There are also some notes from the [Online Masters of Science in Computer Science, Georgia Tech (OMSCS)](online_masters_of_science_in_computer_science,_georgia_tech_(omscs).md).
