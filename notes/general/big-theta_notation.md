# Big-Theta notation

[Big-Theta notation](big-theta_notation.md) is the tight bound on the [runtime](run_time_complexity.md) of an algorithm. This is only really defined when some function is the following $f = O(g)$ using [Big-O notation](big-o_notation.md) and $f = \Omega(g)$ then we have $f=\Theta(g)$ using [Big-Theta notation](big-theta_notation.md) this is also an equivalence relation, so $g = \Theta(f)$ as well.
