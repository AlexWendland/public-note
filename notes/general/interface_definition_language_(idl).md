>[!tldr] Interface definition language (IDL)
>An *Interface Definition Language (IDL)* is a [formal language](formal_language.md) used to define the interface between software components, especially in [Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)](remote_procedure_calls_(rpc).md) systems. It describes function names, parameters, return types, and data structures in a way that is independent of programming language.
