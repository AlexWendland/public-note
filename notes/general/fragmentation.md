>[!tldr] Fragmentation
>_Fragmentation_ occurs when memory is inefficiently utilized due to gaps or wasted space. It can take two forms:
> - [Internal fragmentation](internal_fragmentation.md) happens when allocated memory blocks are larger than needed, leaving unused space inside them.
>- [External fragmentation](external_fragmentation.md) happens when free memory is split into non-contiguous blocks, preventing the allocation of a large contiguous region despite sufficient total free space.
