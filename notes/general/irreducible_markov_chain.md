>[!tldr] Irreducible Markov chain
>A [Markov chain](markov_chain.md) given by $P \in M_{N,N}(\mathbb{R})$ is *irreducible* if the [directed graph](directed_graph.md) on $V = \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$ given by non-zero values of $P$ has a single [strongly connected component](strongly_connected_components_(directed_graphs).md).
