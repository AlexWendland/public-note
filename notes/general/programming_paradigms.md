When designing a programming language, there are different aspects you can choose to focus on. This leads to different programming paradigms that are useful to know about, and understand the pay offs of each of them.

- [Object Oriented Programming (OOP)](object_oriented_programming_(oop).md)
- [Functional Programming](functional_programming.md)
- [Logical Programming](logical_programming.md)
- [Imperative programming](imperative_programming.md)
