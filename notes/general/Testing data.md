>[!tldr] Testing data
>Within the [[Modelling framework|modelling framework]], *testing data* is a set of observations $T \subset A \times B$ which are normally samples from $X$ and $Y$. You would use this to assess models after they have been trained. This should be kept distinct from you [[Training data]].
