>[!tldr] Internet Protocol (IP)
> This is the only [layer 3](layer_3_network.md) protocol and identifies [hosts](host_(networks).md) on different [networks](network.md). Though here are two versions of this [protocol](protocol_(networks).md) which are [IPv4](internet_protocol_(ipv4).md) and [IPv6](internet_protocol_(ipv6).md). As the names suggests the second [protocol](protocol_(networks).md) is an updated version of the first. This was mainly brought about as [We are running out of IPv4 addresses on the pubic internet](we_are_running_out_of_ipv4_addresses_on_the_pubic_internet.md).
