# Context content conclusion (CCC)

This is a model to structure writing. The idea is to separate what you are writing into 3 discernible blocks:
- Context: Sufficient background information for people to read the content with purpose. This should include motivation and the set up for the problem.
- Content: The substance to what you want to say and you show your approach to the problem.
- Conclusion: Summarise what you have solved and how.

Remember [Start and end point bias](start_and_end_point_bias.md)!

# Advantages

This will provide the reader the full context to understand what you are trying to say and frame it in a way that is memorable.

# Disadvantages

This is assuming a patient reader that is happy to understand the context before getting to the point. This should be used when people already have buy in to what you want to say.
