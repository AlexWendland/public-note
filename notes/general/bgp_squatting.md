>[!tldr] BGP squatting
>This is a form of [BGP Hijacking](bgp_hijacking.md) where the attacking [AS](autonomous_system_(as).md) announces a prefix before the genuine [AS](autonomous_system_(as).md) does - thus becoming the defacto route. This disrupts the flow of traffic to the intended [AS](autonomous_system_(as).md).
