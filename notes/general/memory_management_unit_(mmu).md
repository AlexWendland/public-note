>[!tldr] Memory Management Unit (MMU)
>The _Memory Management Unit (MMU)_ is a hardware component responsible for translating [virtual addresses](virtual_memory.md) used by programs into [physical addresses](physical_memory.md). It works alongside the [operating system](operating_system_(os).md) and uses [page tables](page_table.md) or [segment tables](descriptor_table.md) to perform this translation. The MMU also enforces memory protection, preventing unauthorized access to restricted memory regions.
