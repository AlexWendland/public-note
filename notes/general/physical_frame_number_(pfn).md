>[!tldr] Physical Frame Number (PFN)
> When using [paging](paging_system.md) the [operating system](operating_system_(os).md) breaks up [physical memory](physical_memory.md) into [frames](frame_(networks).md). The *physical frame number* is an index in the [operating system](operating_system_(os).md) abstraction of [RAM](random_access_memory_(ram).md) which acts as one contiguous block. This with an offset can get mapped to a location on [RAM](random_access_memory_(ram).md) by the [memory controller](memory_controller.md).
