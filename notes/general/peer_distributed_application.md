>[!tldr] Peer distributed application
>A Peer distributed application is a [distributed algorithm](distributed_algorithm.md) where nodes in the network act not only as clients (receivers of data) but also as servers (or producers). This is distinguished from a [Peer-peer model](peer-peer_model.md) as there may still be some privileged nodes in the network that handle more of the management workload.
