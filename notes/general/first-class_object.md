# First-class object
This is an entity that can be:
- Created at runtime,
- Assigned to a variable or element in a data structure,
- Passed as an argument to a function, and
- Returned as the result of a function.

In [Python Index](python_index.md) most data types are First-class objects such as [Integers](integers.md), [Floats](floats.md), [Dictionaries](dictionaries.md), [Lists](lists.md) and [Functions](functions.md).
