>[!tldr] Linear regression
> *Linear regression* is the special case of [[Polynomial regression|polynomial regression]] where the degree of the polynomial is 1. Therefore we are restricted to the [[Modelling paradigm|modelling paradigm]] of
> $$f(x) = c_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n c_{i} x_i$$
> where $x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \in A$.
>
> Whilst the may seem more restrictive than [[Polynomial regression|polynomial regression]] with a mutation of the input space linear regression is just as flexible.
