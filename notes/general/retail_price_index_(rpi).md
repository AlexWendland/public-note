# Retail Price Index (RPI)

The retail price index is an old measure of [inflation](inflation.md) in the [United Kingdom (UK)](united_kingdom_(uk).md) that is no longer used by the government or the [Bank of England](bank_of_england.md). It is a [Price Index](price_index.md), a weighted [Arithmetic mean](arithmetic_mean.md) products prices that the average household would buy (including [Mortgage](mortgage.md) repayments) to indicate a change in the cost of living over time. It's use has now been replaced by the [Consumer Price Index (CPI)](consumer_price_index_(cpi).md). The main differences were
- [Retail Price Index (RPI)](retail_price_index_(rpi).md) included [Mortgage](mortgage.md) repayment costs, so was heavily influenced by house prices in the [United Kingdom (UK)](united_kingdom_(uk).md), and
- [Consumer Price Index (CPI)](consumer_price_index_(cpi).md) uses the [Geometric mean](geometric_mean.md) rather than an [Arithmetic mean](arithmetic_mean.md).
