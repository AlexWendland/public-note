>[!tldr] Subnets
> A sub network is a prefix of an [IP address](internet_protocol_(ip).md) normally of length 8, 16, or 24. These form the hierarchy of [IP addresses](internet_protocol_(ip).md).
>
> Subnets can either be represented as an IP address followed by a slash with the prefix length such as 123.145.0.0/16. Or as an [IP address](internet_protocol_(ip).md) with a [network mask](network_mask.md) such as 123.145.0.0 with 255.255.0.0 which represents the same information.
