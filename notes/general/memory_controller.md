>[!tldr] Memory controller
>The *Memory Controller* is a crucial hardware component responsible for managing access to [physical memory](physical_memory.md). It acts as the bridge between the [CPU](central_processing_unit_(cpu).md) and [RAM](random_access_memory_(ram).md), ensuring that memory requests from the processor are handled correctly. Most notably it will map whatever physical [RAM](random_access_memory_(ram).md) you have into one contiguous memory region for the [Memory Management Unit (MMU)](memory_management_unit_(mmu).md) to use. There are different types of memory controllers:
>- [Northbridge Memory Controller](northbridge_memory_controller.md): Separate from the [CPU](central_processing_unit_(cpu).md).
>- [Integrated Memory Controller (IMC)](integrated_memory_controller_(imc).md): Integrated onto the [CPU](central_processing_unit_(cpu).md).
