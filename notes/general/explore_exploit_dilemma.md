>[!tldr] Explore exploit dilemma
>In [Machine Learning](machine_learning.md) there is a dilemma when training a model. You can explore the state space more, which can waste time in places that are irrelevant or you can exploit what you know more but can get you in a rut not finding new ways to do things.
>This same dilemma applies far beyond [machine learning](machine_learning.md) into literally everyone's daily lives.
