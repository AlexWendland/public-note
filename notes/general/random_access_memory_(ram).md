>[!tldr] Random Access Memory (RAM)
> Random access memory is used to temporarily store data relevant to an executing program. Unlike [disk storage](disk_storage.md) RAM is temporary and will lose its state once the machine is turned off. However, RAM is fast access which makes it more usable to programs when they need to access it frequently. [Processes](process.md) access RAM through [virtual memory](virtual_memory.md) which is mapped to [physical memory](physical_memory.md) through [page tables](page_table.md).
