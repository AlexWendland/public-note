>[!tldr] HTTP redirection
>This is a response in the [HTTP](hyper_text_transfer_protocol_(http).md) [protocol](protocol_(networks).md). If a client sends a GET request to server for a particular resource the server can respond with 3xx code and the name of the new server to get the resource from. This causes the client to go to another domain to pick that asset up.
