>[!tldr] Normal distribution
>The *normal distribution* is a continuous [probability distribution](probability_distribution.md) $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow (0,1) \subset \mathbb{R}$ specified by the [mean](arithmetic_mean.md) $\mu$ and [standard deviation](standard_deviation.md) $\sigma$ given by [probability density function](probability_density_function.md)
>$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp \left [ - \frac{1}{2} \left ( \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \right )^2 \right ].$$
>Samples from the distributions would be normally referred to as $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$.
