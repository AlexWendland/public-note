>[!tldr] Prediction
>Within the [modelling framework](modelling_framework.md) a prediction of $f:A \rightarrow B$ is some blackbox function $\hat{f}: A' \rightarrow B$ for some $A' \subset A$ that is attempting to be close to $f$. Most importantly it is not trying to understand the true form of $f$.
