>[!tldr] Induced subgraph
>Given a [graph](graph.md) $G = (V, E)$ ([directed graph](directed_graph.md) or [undirected graph](graph.md)) and a subset of the vertices $X \subset V$. The *induced subgraph* of $G$ on $X$ is the [subgraph](subgraph.md) of $G$ defined by $H = (X, \{(u,v) \in E \vert u,v \in X\})$.
