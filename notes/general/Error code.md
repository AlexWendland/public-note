# Error code

An error code is a numerical or alphanumerical value that represents the status or outcome of an operation in a program. Unlike [[Exception|exceptions]], which interrupt the flow of a program, error codes are returned as the result of a [[Function conventions|function]] or method call to indicate success, failure, or some specific condition. Programs that rely on error codes require explicit checks after each operation to determine whether it was successful and to decide how to proceed based on the returned error code.
