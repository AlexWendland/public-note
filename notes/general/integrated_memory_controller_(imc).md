title: Integrated Memory Controller (IMC)

>[!tldr] Integrated Memory Controller (IMC)
>The *Integrated Memory Controller* is a modern [memory controller](memory_controller.md) that is integrated into the  [CPU](central_processing_unit_(cpu).md). This reduces latency and increases memory bandwidth since the [CPU](central_processing_unit_(cpu).md) can directly access [RAM](random_access_memory_(ram).md).
