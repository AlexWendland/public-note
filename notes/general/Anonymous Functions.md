# Anonymous Functions
These are functions that are not named. They are usually used when you are using a function once and don't want to clutter up the name space.

## Examples
In [[Python Index]] these are implemented in by [[Lambda functions]] but these are explicitly for functions that can be defined in the [[Functional Programming]] paradigm.
