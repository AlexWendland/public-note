>[!tldr] Linear regression
> *Linear regression* is the special case of [polynomial regression](polynomial_regression.md) where the degree of the polynomial is 1. Therefore we are restricted to the [modelling paradigm](modelling_paradigm.md) of
> $$f(x) = c_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n c_{i} x_i$$
> where $x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \in A$.
>
> Whilst the may seem more restrictive than [polynomial regression](polynomial_regression.md) with a mutation of the input space linear regression is just as flexible.
