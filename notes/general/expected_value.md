>[!tldr] Expected value
>For some random variable $X$ with [domain](function_domain.md) $D$ (with a sense of addition and multiplication by $\mathbb{R}$) and [probability density function](probability_density_function.md) $f: D \rightarrow [0,1] \subset \mathbb{R}$ the *expected value* is:
>$$\int_{x \in D} x f(x) \ dx.$$
