>[!tldr] Atomic instruction
>An atomic instruction in computer systems is an operation that is indivisible — it either completes entirely or does not happen at all, with no intermediate state visible to other threads or processors. Atomicity is crucial in [concurrent](concurrency.md) programming to avoid [race condition](race_condition.md) when multiple threads access and modify shared data.
