# Random component analysis

Random component analysis is a form of [linear dimension reduction](linear_dimensionality_reduction.md). It picks a random [linear map](linear_map.md) $p: \mathbb{F}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{F}^m$ and applies that.

This works mainly due to [The curse of dimensionality](the_curse_of_dimensionality.md).
