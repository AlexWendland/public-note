>[!tldr] Peripheral component interconnect (PCI)
>*Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)* is a standard for connecting peripheral devices to a computer's [CPU](central_processing_unit_(cpu).md). It defines a bus that allows hardware components like network cards, sound cards, modems, and storage controllers to communicate with the CPU and memory. PCI supports plug-and-play configuration and allows multiple devices to share the same bus.
