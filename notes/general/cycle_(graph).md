# Cycle (graph)

A *cycle* in a [graph](graph.md) is [path](path_(graph).md) $\{e_i = (x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^{k}$  such that $x_1 = y_k$ and $e_i = e_j \Rightarrow i = j$.

> [!example] Visual representation
> Lets use our simple [graph](graph.md) below
> ![simple_cycle](../../images/excalidraw/simple_cycle.excalidraw.svg)
> In this graph we have a cycle using the vertices $\{1,2,3\}$.
