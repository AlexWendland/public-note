# Degree (graph)

In a [graph](graph.md) the *degree* of vertex is the number of ends of edges that are incidence to the vertex. This is denoted $\mbox{deg}(v)$ for some $v \in V$.

In a graph with no [loops](loop_(graph).md) this is the same as the number of edges that are incident to the vertex. However, for evert [loop](loop_(graph).md) in the graph on that vertex we have a contribution of 2 towards the vertex.
