# Interface

An interface is a standard way for a someone else to interact with an object. There are lots of interfaces you will deal with such as [API's](application_programming_interface_(api).md), library functions, or [UI's](user_interface_(ui).md).

A well defined interface makes objects easy to use and help the process of [Abstraction](abstraction.md).
