>[!tldr] Virtual Local Area Networks (VLAN)
>Virtual Local Area Networks let you break a large physical [switch](switch.md) into multiple virtual switches. It does this by breaking up its ports into small groups that each will be a virtual switch. This means messages within one [port](port.md) range can only go out to ports within that range.
