> [!tldr] Substring
> Given a [sequence](sequence.md) $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ a substring is a [sequence](sequence.md) of consecutive terms of $a_i$. For example $a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, \ldots, a_{i + k-1}, a_{i + k}$. The length of the substring is the number of terms it contains, in the example the length would be $k$.
