# Anonymous Functions
These are functions that are not named. They are usually used when you are using a function once and don't want to clutter up the name space.

## Examples
In [Python Index](python_index.md) these are implemented in by [Lambda functions](lambda_functions.md) but these are explicitly for functions that can be defined in the [Functional Programming](functional_programming.md) paradigm.
