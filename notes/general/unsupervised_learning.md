>[!tldr] Unsupervised learning
>In *unsupervised learning* we are given an input [domain](function_domain.md) $A$ with some [training data](training_data.md) $T \subset A$ which are not labelled (you may or may not be provided with an output [codomain](function_codomain.md) $B$) . The goal is to make some $f: A \rightarrow B$ (and $B$) that groups items that are "related" to one another given $T$.
