>[!tldr] Physical memory
>_Physical memory_ usually refers to the actual [[Random Access Memory (RAM)|RAM]] installed in a computer. However, the term can also have more specific meanings depending on the context. A *physical address* is a reference to a location in this [[RAM]], but in some cases, it may also refer to an abstraction used by the [[Operating system (OS)|operating system]], which treats memory as a contiguous block, even if the physical layout is non-contiguous. The mapping between virtual addresses and physical addresses is handled by the [[Memory Management Unit (MMU)]] and [[Memory controller|memory controller]], which ensure that memory is accessed correctly and efficiently.
