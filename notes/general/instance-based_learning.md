>[!tldr] Instance-based learning
> *Instance-based learning* is a branch of [machine learning](machine_learning.md) where instead of performing generalisations on the [training data](training_data.md) immediately and not refering back to them. It instead stores the instances of the [training data](training_data.md) and uses the when called for a value.
