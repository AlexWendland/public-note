# The Anti-Seducer

Taken from: https://www.grahammann.net/book-notes/the-art-of-seduction-robert-greene

- Seducers draw you in by the focused, individualized attention they pay to you. Anti-Seducers are the opposite: insecure, self-absorbed, and unable to grasp the psychology of another person, they literally repel. Anti-Seducers have no self-awareness, and never realize when they are pestering, imposing, talking too much. They lack the subtlety to create the promise of pleasure that seduction requires. Root out anti-seductive qualities in yourself, and recognize them in others—there is no pleasure or profit in dealing with the Anti-Seducer.
- Anti-Seducers come in many shapes and kinds, but almost all of them share a single attribute, the source of their repellent: insecurity.
- Stamp ungenerosity out. It is an impediment to power and a gross sin in seduction.

# Types of Anti-Seducer

## The Brute 

If seduction is a kind of ceremony or ritual, part of the pleasure is its duration—the time it takes, the waiting that increases anticipation. Brutes have no patience for such things; they are concerned only with their own pleasure, never with yours.

## The Suffocator. 

Suffocators fall in love with you before you are even half-aware of their existence.

A subvariant of the Suffocator is the Doormat, a person who slavishly imitates you.

## The Moralizer. 

Seduction is a game, and should be undertaken with a light heart. All is fair in love and seduction; morality never enters the picture. The character of the Moralizer, however, is rigid. These are people who follow fixed ideas and try to make you bend to their standards.

## The Tightwad. 

Cheapness signals more than a problem with money. It is a sign of something constricted in a person’s character—something that keeps them from letting go or taking a risk. It is the most anti-seductive trait of all, and you cannot allow yourself to give in to it.

## The Bumbler 

Bumblers are self-conscious, and their self-consciousness heightens your own.

In seduction, the key weapon is boldness, refusing the target the time to stop and think. Bumblers have no sense of timing.

## The Windbag

The most effective seductions are driven by looks, indirect actions, physical lures. Words have a place, but too much talk will generally break the spell, heightening surface differences and weighing things down.

## The Reactor 

Reactors are far too sensitive, not to you but to their own egos. They comb your every word and action for signs of a slight to their vanity.

## The Vulgarian

Vulgarians are inattentive to the details that are so important in seduction. You can see this in their personal appearance—their clothes are tasteless by any standard—and in their actions: they do not know that it is sometimes better to control oneself and refuse to give in to one’s impulses.
There is nothing more anti-seductive than feeling that someone has assumed that you are theirs, that you cannot possibly resist them. The slightest appearance of this kind of conceit is deadly to seduction; you must prove yourself, take your time, win your target’s heart.
Excessive pride, without anything to justify it, is highly anti-seductive.
The person who is obviously angling for money or other material reward can only repel. If that is your intention, if you are looking for something other than pleasure—for money, for power—never show it.
The best way to avoid entanglements with Anti-Seducers is to recognize them right away and give them a wide berth, but they often deceive us.
Do not get angry—that may only encourage them or exacerbate their anti-seductive tendencies. Instead, act distant and indifferent, pay no attention to them, make them feel how little they matter to you. The best antidote to an Anti-Seducer is often to be anti-seductive yourself
Remember: seduction is a game of attention, of slowly filling the other person’s mind with your presence. Distance and inattention will create the opposite effect, and can be used as a tactic when the need arises.
