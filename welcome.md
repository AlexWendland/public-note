# Welcome!

This is very much an experiement. The purpose of this is to just [[Wendland Weekly Index|start writing stuff]] ... about all the things I like. So I have a database I am building up. Mainly for my quick reference and for the information to be presented in an [[Alex Wendland]] friendly way!

So some things I am interested in to start: 
- [[Data]]
- [[Python]]
- [[DevOps]]
- [[Maths]]
- [[Politics]]
- [[Philosophy]]

I also like other things but don't think they really belong here, this is mainly for technical stuff.
