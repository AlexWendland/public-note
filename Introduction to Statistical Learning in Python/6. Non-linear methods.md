# Non-linear methods

Transformation of the input space.
- [[Polynomial regression|polynomial regression]]:  Use polynomial features,
- Step functions: Cut region up and take mean,
- Regression splines: Cut region up and fit polynomials with smooth intersections,
	- What is the difference between this and [[Boosting]]?
- Smoothing splines: Similar to regression,
- Local regression: Similar to splines but with overlapping boundaries,
- [[Generalised Additive Models (GAM)]]: Combining all the above,

## Polynomial regression

![[Polynomial regression]]

Here we will focus on $k=1$.

This has issues with error explosion outside a certain region.
