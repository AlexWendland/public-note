# 2023-W11 Wendland Weekly

This week I was skiing in Austria with some friends. It was a lot of fun and I got time to read some of [[Clean Code]] by [[Martin C. Robert]]. This was only up to the end of Chapter 2 (about naming conventions), from it and a [Code Aesthetic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J3wNP6u5YU&ab_channel=CodeAesthetic) video on naming variables I wrote a post about [[Naming conventions]]. Whilst doing this I got in a bit of an argument with myself and [[ChatGPT]] about whether to include the types in the name of a variable. You can find the summary in [[Naming conventions#Don't include the type in the name|Don't include the type in the name]] section.

The main crux of my dilemma is being someone who is in [[Data]] but also wanting to develop my [[Programming]] skills. 

On the [[Programming]] side, done properly I think it is completely unnecessary to include the type in the name of the variable. If you feel you need to for clarity, this is most probably an indicator that your function or class is a little too long. Even if it is very hard to get around the length of the class, the IDE should help you and the name of the variable should make it clear.

Whereas on the [[Data]] side, it is a little less clear. Lots of the scripts we write start out as an exploration of some data set. You keep it fast and loose, hashing stuff together to see what is there. (Interesting side point, )
