# 2023-W09 Wendland Weekly

This week I did a [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) [course](https://realpython.com/courses/url-shortener-fastapi/) on [[Fast API]] with [[Database|Databases]]. It was to build a [URL shortener](https://realpython.com/courses/url-shortener-fastapi/). You can find my current progress my [[GitHub]] [Repo](https://github.com/AlexWendland/fastAPI-test) for this. (At this time I was up to commit [705e264](https://github.com/AlexWendland/fastAPI-test/commit/705e2642a5592a8323b71048cbed856efcc48001).)
