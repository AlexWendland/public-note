# Git
This is my preferred (well ... to be honest the only one I have used) version control system. It allows complete distributed development on code, though most people use a centralised version of this on [[GitHub]], [[GitLab]], or if the are forced [[BitBucket]].

# Index
Following is an index for things about Git:
- [[GitHub]]
- [[Using multiple git profiles]]
- [[Pre-commit hooks]]
