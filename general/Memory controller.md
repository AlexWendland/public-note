>[!tldr] Memory controller
>The *Memory Controller* is a crucial hardware component responsible for managing access to [[Physical memory|physical memory]]. It acts as the bridge between the [[Central processing unit (CPU)|CPU]] and [[Random Access Memory (RAM)|RAM]], ensuring that memory requests from the processor are handled correctly. Most notably it will map whatever physical [[Random Access Memory (RAM)|RAM]] you have into one contiguous memory region for the [[Memory Management Unit (MMU)]] to use. There are different types of memory controllers:
>- [[Northbridge Memory Controller]]: Separate from the [[Central processing unit (CPU)|CPU]].
>- [[Integrated Memory Controller (IMC)]]: Integrated onto the [[Central processing unit (CPU)|CPU]].
