# The 5S Philosophy

This was taken from the book [[Clean Code]] but was created else where:

>[!quote] [[Clean Code]], page 24
>The 5S philosophy comprises these concepts:
> - Seiri, or organization (think â€œsortâ€ in English). Knowing where things areâ€”using approaches such as suitable namingâ€”is crucial. You think naming identifiers isnâ€™t important? Read on in the following chapters.
> - Seiton, or tidiness (think â€œsystematizeâ€ in English). There is an old American saying: A place for everything, and everything in its place. A piece of code should be where you expect to find itâ€”and, if not, you should re-factor to get it there.
> - Seiso, or cleaning (think â€œshineâ€ in English): Keep the workplace free of hanging wires, grease, scraps, and waste. What do the authors here say about littering your code with comments and commented-out code lines that capture history or wishes for the future? Get rid of them.
> - Seiketsu, or standardization: The group agrees about how to keep the workplace clean. Do you think this book says anything about having a consistent coding style and set of practices within the group? Where do those standards come from? Read on.
> - Shutsuke, or discipline (self-discipline). This means having the discipline to follow the practices and to frequently reflect on oneâ€™s work and be willing to change.
