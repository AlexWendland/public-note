>[!tldr] Northbridge Memory Controller
>The *northbridge memory controller* is a form of [[Memory controller|memory controller]] which is used in older architectures. The [[Memory controller|memory controller]] was located on the Northbridge chipset (separate from the [[Central processing unit (CPU)|CPU]]). This design introduced latency since memory requests had to travel through the Northbridge before reaching [[Random Access Memory (RAM)|RAM]].
