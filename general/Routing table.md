>[!tldr] Routing table
>Routers keep a table of where [[Packets|packets]] [[Internet Protocol (IPv4)|IP addresses]] addresses belong to which connection for redirecting messages. This table maps the tuple of an [[Internet Protocol (IPv4)]] and a [[Network mask|network mask]] to either an interface or a [[Internet Protocol (IPv4)]]. You can use [[Route summarization]] to keep a routing table short.
