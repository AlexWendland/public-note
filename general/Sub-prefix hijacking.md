>[!tldr] Sub-prefix hijacking
>This is a form of [[BGP Hijacking]] where the attacking [[Autonomous system (AS)|AS]] announces a sub-path for a prefix a genuine [[Autonomous system (AS)|AS]] announced. This will be preferentially used as it is a more precise prefix. This disrupts the flow of traffic to the intended [[Autonomous system (AS)|AS]].
