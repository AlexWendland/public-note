>[!tldr] Stochastic matrix
>A [[Matrix|matrix]] $P \in M_{n \times m}(\mathbb{R})$ is called *stochastic* if for all $i \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $1 \leq i \leq n$ we have
>$$ \sum_{j = 1}^m p_{i,j} = 1$$
>and for $1 \leq i \leq n$ and $1 \leq j \leq m$ we have $0 \leq p_{i,j} \leq 1$. Therefore every row forms a probability distribution.
