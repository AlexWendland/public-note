# Interface

An interface is a standard way for a someone else to interact with an object. There are lots of interfaces you will deal with such as [[Application Programming Interface (API)|API's]], library functions, or [[User Interface (UI)|UI's]].

A well defined interface makes objects easy to use and help the process of [[Abstraction]].
