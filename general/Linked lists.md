# Trade offs

Linked lists are good data structures when you don't know the size of the information that the beginning. To add or delete elements only requires updating a couple of points whereas in an [[Array (data structure)|array]] it may involve copying a lot of data. This also allows for storing different bits of the list in different memory locations - this can have some efficiency losses if you do it too much.

However looking up elements by index is very slow in comparison to an [[Array (data structure)|array]] whereas it has the same speed as going through the whole data structure.
