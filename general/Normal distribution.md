>[!tldr] Normal distribution
>The *normal distribution* is a continuous [[Probability distribution|probability distribution]] $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow (0,1) \subset \mathbb{R}$ specified by the [[Arithmetic mean|mean]] $\mu$ and [[standard deviation]] $\sigma$ given by [[Density function|density function]]
>$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp \left [ - \frac{1}{2} \left ( \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \right )^2 \right ].$$
>Samples from the distributions would be normally referred to as $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$.
