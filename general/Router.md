>[!tldr] Routers
> A router is any device that implements [[Routing]].  They provide a traffic control point between [[Network|networks]]. This is a good place to apply security filtering or redirecting. A router will have an [[Internet Protocol (IPv4)]] on each [[Network|network]] it is connected to which will be its [[Gateway]] on that [[Network|network]].
