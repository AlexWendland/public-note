# Simulated Annealing

Suppose we have a [[Optimisation problem|optimisation problem]] where $A$ has some sense of neighbourhood $N(a)$ for each point $a \in A$.

Then we want to emulate [[Hill climbing]] but probabilistically allow for random walking. We do this by randomly deciding to take downhill moves based on the temperature of the
