# Conventions

Whilst I have written summaries of the conventions from [[Clean Code]] and added in some comments about my preferences. The main thing to remember is that the **team conventions are the ones that matter**. The purpose of conventions is for teams to work better together, when you look at file and your brain doesn't have to mentally map the code to how to like to read code. The team rules, when it comes to conventions. Whenever you start a new project, get the people who are working on it to agree on a standard and then write what that is down or better implement a [[Linter]] to automatically apply the standard when saving or pushing to the common repository.
