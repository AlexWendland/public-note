>[!tldr] Weak learner
>Suppose we are in the [[Modelling framework|modelling framework]] a model $\hat{f}$ is called a *weak learner* if for all probability distributions $\mathbb{D}: A \rightarrow [0,1]$ there exists a suffciently small $\epsilon$ such that
>$$\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{D}}[\hat{f}(x) \neq f(x)] \leq 0.5 - \epsilon.$$
>That is its [[Error rate (modelling)|error rate]] is just bellow chance.
