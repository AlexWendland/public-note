>[!tldr] Context switch
>A *context switch* is when the [[Central processing unit (CPU)|CPU]] goes from running one [[Process|process]] to running a different one. This involves writing the old [[Process|processes]] [[Process control block (PCB)|PCB]] into memory and fetching the second processes [[Process control block (PCB)|PCB]] from memory and loading it into the [[CPU register|CPU registers]].
