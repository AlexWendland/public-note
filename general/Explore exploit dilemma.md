>[!tldr] Explore exploit dilemma
>In [[Machine Learning]] there is a dilemma when training a model. You can explore the state space more, which can waste time in places that are irrelevant or you can exploit what you know more but can get you in a rut not finding new ways to do things. 
>This same dilemma applies far beyond [[Machine Learning|machine learning]] into literally everyone's daily lives.
