# Statement

> [!important] Lemma
> In an $n$-player pure strategy game, if elimination of [[Strictly dominated strategy]] eliminates all but one combination of strategies, that combination is the unique [[Nash equilibrium]].
> Similarly a [[Nash equilibrium]] can never be [[Strictly dominated strategy|strictly dominated]].

# Proof
