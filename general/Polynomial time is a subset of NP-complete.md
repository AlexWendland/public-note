# Statement

>[!important] Lemma
>The class of [[Polynomial time]] problems is a subset of [[Nondeterministic Polynomial time (NP)]].

# Proof

If the problem is in [[Nondeterministic Polynomial time (NP)|NP]] then we already know the problem is a [[Search problems|search problem]]. Therefore it is in the class [[Nondeterministic Polynomial time (NP)|Nondeterministic Polynomial time]].
