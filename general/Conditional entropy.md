>[!tldr] Conditional entropy
>Suppose we have two [[Random variable|random variables]] $X$ and $Y$ over different [[Function domain|domains]] $A$ and $B$. The *conditional entropy* is defined by
>$$H(Y \vert X) = - \sum_{a \in A} \sum_{b \in B} \mathbb{P}[X = a, Y = b] \log_2(\mathbb{P}[Y = b \vert X = a]).$$
