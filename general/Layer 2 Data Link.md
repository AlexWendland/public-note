>[!tldr] Layer 2 Data Link
>Layer 2 of the [[Open Systems interconnection (OSI) model|OSI model]] concerns itself with [[MAC address|MAC addresses]] and within [[Network|network]] communication. It will have a header that stores the source and destination [[MAC address]] of the current hop within a [[Network|network]]. These are tools that put data on or off the [[Layer 1 Physical|Physical layer]]. For example:
>- [[Network Interface Cards (NIC)]],
>- Wifi access cards, or
>- [[Switch|Switches]].
>
>These devices all have unique [[MAC address]].
