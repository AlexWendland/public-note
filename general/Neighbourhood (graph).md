>[!tldr] Neighbourhood
>For a [[Graph|undirected graph]] $G = (V,E)$ the *neighbourhood* of $X \subset V$ is $N_G(X) = \{u \in V \vert (x,u) \in E, x \in X\}$ ($\backslash X$, $\cup X$). Sometimes this will be defined to include $X$ or exclude $X$ - this is called open and closed neighbourhoods.

## Directed graph

In a directed this would normally be specified inbound or outbound neighbourhoods.

>[!tldr] Inbound / outbound neighbourhood
>For a [[Directed graph|directed graph]] $G = (V,E)$ and $X \subset V$ we define:
>- the *inbound neighbourhood* of $X$ to be $N^{in}_G(X) = \{u \in V \vert (u,x) \in E, x \in X\}$, and
>- the *outbound neighbourhood* of $X$ to be $N^{out}_G(X) = \{u \in V \vert (x,u) \in E, x \in X\}$, and
>- the *neighbourhood* of $X$ to be $N_G(X) = N^{in}_G(X) \cup N^{out}_G(X)$.
