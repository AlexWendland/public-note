# Edmonds-Karp algorithm

This is an algorithm to solve the [[Max flow problem|max flow]] problem but also solves the [[Min st-cut problem|min st-cut]] problem on a [[Flow network|flow network]] $(G = (V,E), c, s, t)$. This is very similar to the [[Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm]] but with the use of [[Breath-first search (BFS)|BFS]] when picking the s-t path.

## Algorithm

```pseudocode
edmonds_karp(G, c, s, t)
	Input: A flow network.
	Output: A max flow on the network.
1. Set f(e) = 0 for all e in E.
2. Build the residual network G^f for the current flow f.
3. Check for any s-t paths p in G^f using BFS.
	1. If no such path then output f.
4. Given p let c(p) = min_{e in p} c^f(e).
5. Augment f by c(p) units along p.
	1. f(e) = f(e) + c(p) for forward edges.
	2. f(e) = f(e) - c(p) for backward edges.
6. Repeat from step 2.
```

## Correctness

This proof is the same as [[Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm]].

## Run time

This takes $O(\vert E \vert^2 \cdot \vert V \vert)$.

From [[Edmonds-Karp algorithm#Claim 1|Claim 1]] we know we only have to loop $\vert E \vert \cdot \vert V \vert /2$ times.

To run each iteration we need need to update the path length number of edges in the graph $G^f$ which takes $O(\vert V \vert)$ time. We need to run [[Breath-first search (BFS)|BFS]] which takes $O(\vert V \vert + \vert E \vert) = O(\vert E \vert)$ if we assume $G$ is connected. Then calculating $c(p)$ and updating the weights also takes $O(\vert V \vert)$ time. So all together a single iteration takes $O(\vert E \vert)$ time.

Therefore together this takes $O(\vert E \vert^2 \cdot \vert V \vert)$ times.

## Proof of claims

A bit of notation will help us understand what is going.

Suppose we have flows $f_i$ during the course of the algorithm - with $f_1$ being the empty flow and $f_k$ being the returned flow.

Let $p_i$ be the augmenting path in $G^{f_i}$ to make $f_{i+1}$ for $1 \leq i < k$.

Let $dist_i: V \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$ be the edge distance from $s$ to $v$ as produced by our run of the [[Depth-first search (DFS)|DFS]] to produce path $p_i$.

## Claim 1

>[!important] Claim 1
>The algorithm has at most $\vert E \vert \cdot \vert V \vert/2$ loops. i.e. $k \leq \vert E \vert \cdot \vert V \vert/2$.

### Proof

Note that as we let $c(p_i) = \min_{e \in p_i} c^{f_i}(e)$ in each round of the algorithm we remove at least one edge of $G^{f_i}$ to make $G^{f_{i+1}}$. (This isn't to say the number of edges reduces each round - as we may add in more edges to $G^f$ than we have deleted.)

From [[Edmonds-Karp algorithm#Claim 2|Claim 2]] we know each edge gets deleted and reinserted to $G^f$ at most $\vert V \vert/2$ times.

Therefore we can only iterate $\vert E \vert \cdot \vert V \vert / 2$ times. As there has to be an edge to remove.

## Claim 2

>[!important] Claim 2
>For every edge $e \in E$, $e$ is deleted and reinserted to $G^f$ at most $\vert V \vert/2$ times.

### Proof

Let $e = (y,z)$ then from [[Edmonds-Karp algorithm#Claim 3|Claim 3]] every time we remove and add $e$ the distance between $s$ and $y$ increases by 2.  As the distance between $y$ and $s$ can be at most $\vert V \vert - 1$. This can only happen less than $\vert V \vert / 2$ times.

## Claim 3

>[!important] Claim 3
>Suppose edge $(y,z)$ is removed from $G^{f_i}$ and added back to $G^{f_{j+1}}$. Then $dist_j(y) \geq dist_i(y) + 2$.
>

## Proof

As we delete $(y,z)$ from $G^{f_i}$ from [[Edmonds-Karp algorithm#Claim 5|Claim 5]] $(y,z) \in p_i$ therefore
$$dist_i(z) = dist_i(y) + 1.$$
From [[Edmonds-Karp algorithm#Claim 4|Claim 4]] we have that
$$dist_i(z) \leq dist_{j-1}(z), \mbox{ and } dist_i(y) \leq dist_{j-1}(y).$$
As we add $(y,z)$ to $G^{f_{j+1}}$ from [[Edmonds-Karp algorithm#Claim 5|Claim 5]] $(z,y) \in p_{j}$ therefore
$$dist_j(y) = dist_j(z) + 1.$$
Combining this all together we have
$$\begin{align*} dist_j(y) & = dist_j(z) + 1 & \mbox{from the last statment}\\
& \geq dist_i(z) + 1 & \mbox{from the second statement}\\
& \geq (dist_i(y) + 1) + 1 & \mbox{ from the first statement}\\
& \geq dist_i(y) + 2\end{align*}$$
as claimed.

## Claim 4

>[!important] Claim 4
>For all $v \in V$ $dist_i(v) \leq dist_j(v)$ for all $j \geq i$.

### Proof

Suppose an edge $(y,z)$ is added to the [[Residual Network (flow)|residual network]] $G^{f_i}$ to make $G^{f_{i+1}}$. From [[Edmonds-Karp algorithm#Claim 5|Claim 5]] this means $(z,y) \in p_i$ a path generated by a run of [[Breath-first search (BFS)|BFS]] on $G^{f_i}$.

Therefore $dist_{i}(y) = dist_{i}(z) + 1$. After adding $(y,z)$ this means
$$dist_{i+1}(z) = \min\{dist_{i}(z), dist_{i}(z) + 2\} = dist_{i}(z)$$
so $dist_{i+1}(z)$ hasn't decreased by adding $(y,z)$ however it may increase if we remove edges.

Therefore as the distance to the terminus of an edge being added hasn't increased no other edge distances can increase. If we remove edges, distances between vertices can increase.

## Claim 5

>[!important] Claim 5
>If we add $(y,z)$ to $G^{f_{i+1}}$ then $(z,y) \in p_{i}$.
>If we remove $(y,z)$ from $G^{f_i}$ then $(y,z) \in p_i$.


## Proof

For a given edge $(v,w) \in E$ we have the following conditions for it to be added or removed from the [[Residual Network (flow)|residual network]] $G^{f_i}$ to make $G^{f_{i+1}}$:

- Add $(v,w)$ to $G^{f_{i+1}}$ if the [[Flow|flow]] was full on $(v,w)$ and was reduced by $p_i$.
	- So $(w,v) \in p_i$.
- Remove $(v,w)$ from $G^{f_i}$ if the [[Flow|flow]] is now full.
	- So $(v,w) \in p_i$.
- Add $(w,v)$ to $G^{f_{i+1}}$ if the [[Flow|flow]] was empty.
	- So $(v,w) \in p_i$.
- Remove $(w,v)$ from $G^{f_i}$ if the [[Flow|flow]] was positive and is now empty.
	- So $(w,v) \in p_i$.

So if we add $(y,z)$ to $G^{f_{i+1}}$ then $(z,y) \in p_i$.

Similarly if we remove $(y,z)$ from $G^{f_i}$ then $(y,z) \in p_i$.
