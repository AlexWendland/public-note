>[!tldr] Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
>This [[Protocol (networks)|protocol]] handles the signalling used in [[Voice over IP (VoIP)|VoIP]] applications. Signalling traditionally this takes care of how calls are set up and torn down. This has four major responsibilities.
>
>	1. User location - the parties finding one another,
>	2. Session establishment - handling the callee accepting, rejecting or redirecting the call,
>	3. Session negotiation - endpoint synchronizing on the same standard,
>	4. Call participation management - handling people joining or leaving.p
