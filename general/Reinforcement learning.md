>[!tldr] Reinforcement learning
>This is a branch of [[Machine Learning]] applied in a setting where a learner has a number of actions to take in a given state - each action will lead to a different reward and we want to maximise it. You are provided with previous [[Transitions (MDP)|transitions]] and want to build a policy in the sense of a [[Markov decision process]].
