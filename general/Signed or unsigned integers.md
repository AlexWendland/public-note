# Signed integers

When storing [[Integer|integers]] in a computer, you can do it with a 'sign' or without it. This essentially just means you designate one [[bit]] at the start of the representation of that [[Integer|integer]] which indicates it is either positive or negative number.

This means unsigned [[Integer|integers]] can store larger numbers but can't become negative.
