>[!tldr] Subnets
> A sub network is a prefix of an [[Internet Protocol (IP)|IP address]] normally of length 8, 16, or 24. These form the hierarchy of [[Internet Protocol (IP)|IP addresses]].
> 
> Subnets can either be represented as an IP address followed by a slash with the prefix length such as 123.145.0.0/16. Or as an [[Internet Protocol (IP)|IP address]] with a [[Network mask|network mask]] such as 123.145.0.0 with 255.255.0.0 which represents the same information.
