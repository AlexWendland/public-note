>[!tldr] Semaphores
> **Semaphores** are a [[Synchronization|synchronization]] construct used to control access to shared resources. A semaphore is initialized with an integer value (often called the **capacity**). It maintains a counter that represents the number of available "permits." When a [[Thread|thread]] attempts to acquire the semaphore:
>
>- If the counter is greater than 0, the thread decrements it and proceeds.
>- If the counter is 0, the thread blocks (waits) until another thread releases the semaphore.
  >  
>When a thread releases the semaphore, the counter is incremented by 1, potentially waking a waiting thread.  
>This mechanism ensures that at most the initial number of threads (the max count) can hold the semaphore concurrently.
