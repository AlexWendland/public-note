>[!tldr] DSN-based content delivery
>[[Content delivery network (CDN)]] use [[Domain Name System (DNS)|DNS]]-based methods to efficiently deliver content by distributing it across multiple servers worldwide. When a user requests a service via DNS, the CDN determines the "nearest edge server" based on factors such as network topology and current link characteristics. This server's IP address is then returned to the user's DNS client, ensuring that content is delivered from a location that is geographically or network-proximity closer to the user.
>
>This approach enhances responsiveness and availability because the content is served from a closer location, reducing latency. CDNs also have the ability to quickly adapt to changes in network conditions due to their use of shorter [[Time to live (TTL)|TTL]]s compared to traditional round-robin DNS. This ensures optimal performance by dynamically redirecting traffic to the best available server based on real-time network conditions.
