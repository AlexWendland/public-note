# How I think about work

Several things in life have prompted me to think more deliberately about work: doing a master's degree while working (stressful), reading *The 4-Hour Work Week*, diving into Stoic and Taoist philosophy, and getting turned down for a promotion.

So I think it's time to do some thinking on paper and see what comes out!

>[!warning] Health warning: This is for overachievers
>If you're looking for an excuse not to push yourself, this isn't it. This piece is aimed at people who already work hard and might be sacrificing too much present happiness for uncertain future rewards. If you're naturally lazy or avoiding challenges, go read something about growth mindset instead.

## Work is just solving a money problem

My main takeaway from *The 4-Hour Work Week* was this: work is the solution to a problem. The problem is not having enough money to do the things we want in life. When we face a problem, we should solve the problem, not fixate on the solution. No 'what job do you want to have when you grow up'.

So let's frame the problem correctly. I need about £2,500/month after tax to live like I do now in London (expensive city, I'm lazy about cooking). If I want this lifestyle for my whole life but only work until 65, I need to earn roughly £4,000/month after tax.

>[!note] For the nerds
>See the appendix for the detailed math on how I got to £4,000/month - it's just basic arithmetic but I found working through the numbers really helpful for thinking about this stuff.

More money is always good - but only if the cost is right.

But obviously not all work is created equal. Some work I love, some I hate. So let's try to be systematic about the trade-off between money and misery.

## A framework for the money/misery trade-off

Instead of just thinking "do I like this job or not," I try to weight 1 hour of doing different activities on a scale from 0 (love it) to 1 (hate it). When scoring a an activity you may want to factor in the following:

- Do I enjoy the actual work?
- Does it teach me valuable skills?
- Does it position me for better opportunities?
- Does it contribute to something I care about?

For example, as a developer:
- Coding something I'm proud of with no time pressure: 0 (love it)
- Reviewing code of a good engineer: 0.4 (great to see others code)
- Debugging production issues: 0.7 (stressful and too much information)
- Pointless status meetings: 1 (pure waste of time)

Right now I work about 33 hours/week (after accounting for holidays) and my weighted unhappiness is around 0.7, so that's about 23 hours of "misery" per week. For at least £5,200/month, that feels pretty good.

Here's the awkward bit though: I actually earn closer to £7,500/month. So I'm earning almost double what I "need" according to my own math. You'd think this would make me immediately quit or go part-time, but... I haven't. More on this contradiction later.

The framework is simple: map your income against your weighted unhappiness hours, and figure out what trade-offs make sense for you. More money for the same misery is better. Less misery for the same money is better. I personally found drawing a graph really helps with this:

![[Life graph contors.excalidraw]]

I should acknowledge this assumes I have choices - I'm privileged to have in-demand skills, good health, and low responsibilities. But even with limited options, the core question remains: what trade-off between money and misery makes sense for you?

## But here's the thing about "growth"

Here's where I need to be controversial (or maybe just honest). I'm not sure optimizing for future outcomes is as smart as we think it is.

I can sink lots of time into things. I did this during my undergrad because I thought getting my degree would be amazing. I got a good degree, but the moment I got it felt hollow - like I'd somehow cheated the system or it was not worth achieving. The weird thing is, "doing the work" I actually found very rewarding - learning Math's I loved.

Same with my PhD. It was transformational - I lost weight, had my first partner, made great friends, started to build an actual personality and first listened to philosophy. But I was always focused on getting the PhD itself, which again felt cheap when it happened (thanks, COVID). What I loved was the journey, not the destination.

>[!quote] My PhD examiner
>If this was a real viva (PhD exam) I would make you ...

I have been reading Stoic and Taoist philosophy recently. Stoics teach you can only control your actions, not outcomes. Taoists talk about wu wei - going with the natural flow rather than forcing outcomes. Both suggest obsessing over destinations you can't control is a recipe for suffering.

**The career capital trap**: We're constantly told to "invest in our careers" - take the boring job that teaches skills, network strategically, build our "brand." But what if you spend years building capital for a career you end up hating? What if the industry changes? (Hey AI!) What if you change?

**Growth is just change**: People use "growth" like it's inherently positive, but growth is just change. If you need to go left, growing up doesn't help you. When we want to change, the best way is to change in a direction that lets us do more of what we already like doing.

**The path of least resistance isn't lazy**: Maybe choosing what feels right now, what you actually enjoy doing, isn't short-sighted. Maybe it's wisdom. You know you'll take at least two steps in that direction. You don't know if you'll reach some imagined destination.

**Why does older me deserve such a great life?**: Here's what really gets me - I'm in my early 30s, I have energy, I'm healthy, I'm curious about everything. Why am I optimizing so hard for the 65-year-old version of me? What did that guy do to deserve all this sacrifice from current me? That older version might not even exist, might have different priorities, might be dealing with health issues that make all this wealth accumulation pointless. Current me is here right now, full of energy and life - maybe he deserves some consideration too.

This suggests we should weight "immediate satisfaction" much more heavily in our framework. Not because we're hedonistic, but because the process is what we actually experience. The destination might be a mirage.

## So how should I actually use this framework?

So what does all this rambling actually mean? Some practical takeaways:

1. **Trust your gut, then use the framework to articulate why**: If something feels wrong, it probably is. The framework just helps you explain why to yourself and others.

2. **Weight present satisfaction more heavily**: I used to think suffering now for future benefits was smart. Now I think it's often just delayed gratification that never pays off the way you expect.

3. **Pick a journey, not a destination**: Choose work that lets you do more of what you already enjoy, rather than optimizing for some imagined future self.

4. **The path of least resistance might be wise**: What feels natural and sustainable right now might be better guidance than what looks strategically optimal.

So here's the embarrassing truth: I currently earn £7,500/month but only "need" £4,000/month according to my own framework. I'm literally earning almost double what I claim to need, yet I'm still working full-time. I am learning, building things, keeping the hour cost fairly low - but I'm also clearly not following my own advice.

Maybe I should actually take my advice and halve my hours for half the pay - it would put me higher on my own satisfaction rating! But here I am, still grinding away like an idiot. Part of it is building a buffer for uncertainty, but honestly? Part of it is probably just the default mode of "more money = better" that this whole framework is supposed to challenge.

I believe some younger people need to be more skeptical of sacrificing present happiness for uncertain future rewards. The journey is what you actually experience.

## Appendix: The boring math

For the nerds who wanted to see how I got to £4,000/month:

I currently spend £2,500/month after tax in London:
- Rent: £750
- Day-to-day expenses: £1,500 (yes, I'm lazy about cooking)
- Holiday fund: £250

If I want this lifestyle until I'm 85 (53 years) but only work until 65 (33 years), the math is:
- Total money needed: £2,500 × 12 months × 53 years = £1,590,000
- Working years: 33 years
- Monthly earnings needed: £1,590,000 ÷ (33 × 12) = £4,015/month

So roughly £4,000/month after tax. Right now I earn about £7,500/month, so I'm earning almost double what I actually "need." Which raises some interesting questions about what I'm optimizing for...
