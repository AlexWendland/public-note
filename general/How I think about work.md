# How I think about work

Several things in life have prompted me to think more deliberately about work:

- I am doing a master's degree and working a job at the same time - which is stressing me out,
- I read [The 4-Hour Work Week](https://fourhourworkweek.com/),
- I have been reading several books on stoic and Taoist philosophy, 
- I got turned down for a promotion last year - without much explanation,
- I realized when my manager asks if I want to do a project or not, I don't have a system to think about my response,
- I am hopefully moving to the US soon, and
- I spoke to a friend who asked what I wanted in a job.

So I think it's time to do some thinking on paper and see what comes out!

My real takeaway from the 4-hour work week was the following statement:

>[!important] Work is the solution to a problem
> The problem work solves is not having enough money to do the things we want in life. When we face a problem, we need to solve the problem and not fixate too much on the solution. So let's first frame the problem correctly so we can look at solutions.

So in this exploration I want to develop a framework that will aid me in making decisions when considering different actions I can take like:

- Do I want to work at this job?
- Do I want to do a startup?
- Should I say yes to this promotion?
- Should I agree to work on this project?

## A note on privilege

Before diving in, I should acknowledge that this entire framework assumes I have choices - the ability to turn down promotions, select projects, or even change jobs. This comes from significant privilege: I have a PhD in mathematics, my skills are in high demand, I have my health, and I have low family responsibilities.

However, I believe this framework can still be useful even with limited choices. If you're choosing between two jobs you don't love, or weighing whether to take on extra responsibilities, the core question remains: what trade-off between money and misery makes sense for you? The framework just helps you be more systematic about that trade-off, even when your options are constrained.

The key insight - that work is a solution to the problem of not having enough money - applies regardless of your privilege level. The main difference is how many alternative solutions you have access to.

## What do I want to do and what do I need to do it?

My hobbies are fairly cheap:
- Running
- Programming
- Board games
- Learning

The main substantial activity I have in life is visiting my wife Janet in the US and traveling with her. I wouldn't say traveling is a hobby of mine, but I like seeing different cultures and love seeing Janet happy.

I live in London, which is EXPENSIVE. I have tried to keep lifestyle inflation down, but my expenses have gone up since I was a student. So let's get to the numbers:

>[!note] I am keeping costs per month - that is just how I think

| Activity            | Cost per month (£) |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Rent                | 750                |
| Day to day expenses | 1500               |
| Holiday fund        | 250                |
| **Total**           | **2500**           |

My day-to-day expenses are quite large - this is mainly because I am lazy. I pay for a meal service and eat lunches out, which costs about £700 by itself. To be honest, I am not 100% sure what the rest is... that is most probably a blog post in itself - I do have the data!

OK, so financially I need £2,500 per month after tax to live like I do at the moment... well, do I?

I did a PhD, so I am going to consider time before 25 just sunk time that our lovely government or parents pay for. Between 25-65 I am going to assume I work 90% of the time, giving me 36 years of work. I am going to be optimistic and assume I live until 85. So I need to earn (85-25 = 60 × 12 × 2500) post-tax income using 36 years of work.

Let's break that down to a per-month post-tax number to keep it simple. This is:
$$2500 × 60 ÷ 36 = 4166.66... ≈ 4200$$ 

>[!note] FIRE people
>For the Financially Independent Retire Early people, you can shorten the time horizon by just reducing the number of years you work.

## A more nuanced "cost of work"

OK, so work is the solution, but I am not going to pretend all work is created equal. It is perfectly possible to do work you love, so when thinking about work as a 'cost' I think that is a little harsh.

Instead, let's use a metric called 'Weighted unhappiness hours per week'. This isn't just about immediate enjoyment - it should factor in multiple dimensions:

- **Immediate satisfaction**: Do you enjoy the actual work?
- **Learning value**: Even if boring, does it teach you valuable skills?  
- **Career capital**: Does it position you for better opportunities?
- **Network effects**: Does it put you in rooms with interesting people?
- **Future flexibility**: Does it give you more choices later?
- **Purpose and meaning**: Does it contribute to something you care about?

The key insight is that the 0-1 scale represents your overall assessment of how this time investment serves your goals - not just how fun it is in the moment.

I am a developer. I love just being in my room working on code that does something cool. But being a developer isn't just that... it is a lot of other stuff. Here's how I might weight different activities considering all factors:

- **No time pressure coding on something I am proud of: 0**
	- Love it, builds skills I want, creates portfolio pieces
- **Pair programming with a brilliant mentor: 0**
	- If it could go negative... I would let it - massive learning value
- **Boring project but learning new framework: 0.3** 
	- Terrible day-to-day, but learning React opens up freelance opportunities
- **High-profile project with difficult stakeholders: 0.4**
	- Stressful and annoying, but great for career capital and network building
- **Mentoring a junior engineer who is receptive to learning: 0.1**
	- I am not good with people, but I find it very rewarding and builds leadership skills
- **No time pressure coding in a rat's nest of a codebase: 0.5**
	- OK... not fun, but I like complaining and it's still coding practice
- **Code reviewing someone who doesn't care about their code: 0.9**
	- Ugh, frustrating and teaches me nothing new
- **Writing ADRs/RFCs, researching code: 0.2**
	- I know a lot of people don't like it, but I love putting my detective hat on plus builds communication skills
- **Debugging production issues: 0.7**
	- Stressful and information overload, but does build valuable troubleshooting skills
- **Pointless status meetings: 1**
	- Mouth talking, ears listening, eyes drooping - zero value add
- **Slack notifications: 1**
	- Ugh, ping ping ping... please stop - pure distraction

I think you get the point - you can look at a job or project and roughly work out how much time you'll spend not enjoying yourself.

>[!Example] Flow state
>I think a pretty good judge of whether you like something or not is how time passes while you're doing it. If it is effortless action for you, you like it - whether you want to or not. Try to be honest with yourself.

>[!Example] Framework with limited choices
>Even if you can't turn down work, you can still optimize using this framework:
>
>**Between two job offers:**
>- Job A: £32k, boring but great training program (weighted score: 0.6)
>- Job B: £35k, more interesting but dead-end role (weighted score: 0.7)
>- The traditional advice says take Job A for "career capital." But what if you hate that career path once you've built the capital? What if Job B leads to unexpected opportunities through the people you meet?
>
>**Side hustles:**
>- Weekend freelancing: Extra £500/month but 0.8 misery (tired, family time lost)
>- Online course creation: Less immediate money but 0.3 misery (builds expertise, scalable income)
>- The framework helps you weigh immediate vs future benefits, but remember - you only control the present choice
>
>**Skill development:**
>- Professional certification: 6 months of 0.9 misery studying, but unlocks 20% salary bump
>- But ask yourself: Do you actually want that career path? Or are you optimizing for a future you might not even want?

OK, so ideally we keep the 'Weighted unhappiness hours per week' to a bare minimum. 

If you are shouting at the screen right now saying "life isn't this simple, I have other commitments like childcare, looking after relatives, doing university, or some other commitment" - then say every hour you have to work instead of doing those commitments is an hour you don't enjoy yourself, or simpler still, just use the total amount of hours you need to work.

If you are shouting at the screen, "what about purpose? I don't enjoy my work but I feel like a great person for doing it" - then factor it in. Having purpose in your role is super meaningful and it makes the days go faster as you achieve something great. 

For example, you might hate the day-to-day of being a teacher (dealing with bureaucracy, difficult parents, low pay) but find deep satisfaction in helping kids learn. In this case, you'd weight those "teaching moments" much lower (maybe 0.2) while the bureaucracy stays high (0.9). The overall weighted score might still justify the role despite the challenges.

Purpose acts as a multiplier that can dramatically change how you experience otherwise difficult work. Therefore, the hours you work are a little less... terrible. 

## The Framework: A Visual Approach

OK, so we have:
1. **Post-tax monthly income** - my goal, enough to fund my hobbies and lifestyle
2. **The cost of work** - weighted unhappiness hours per week (factoring in learning, career capital, purpose, etc.)
3. **A rating** - how I feel about being in that situation

We can express this as a function:

$$
f: \text{post-tax monthly income} × \text{weighted unhappiness hours per week} → \text{satisfaction rating}
$$

>[!note] I use hours per week as that is how I think
>I know it is not consistent with the pay unit... unlucky.

This will materialize as a 2D graph with contour lines showing how I feel about being in different situations.

## Where I am right now

### Current Financial Situation

To know where you want to go, it is good to know where you are. Let's start simple: money.

I get paid £91,500 a year base salary. Last year I received a discretionary bonus of 50% of my salary. I also get a 5% pension contribution paid by my company. This works out to:

| Scenario                          | Post-tax monthly income (£) |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Current baseline (need)           | 2,500                        |
| UK average income (reference)     | 3,250                        |
| 36 years of work (need)           | 4,200                        |
| London average income (reference) | 4,350                        |
| My salary with pension            | 5,200                        |
| My salary with pension + bonus    | 7,500                        |

>[!note] References and assumptions
>- I donate 10% of my income to charity, which is subtracted from these figures
>- I buy additional holiday days, which is subtracted from my pay along with other benefits
>- Average salaries were taken from [plumplot](https://www.plumplot.co.uk/London-salary-and-unemployment.html)
>- I used the [government income tax calculator](https://www.gov.uk/estimate-income-tax) to account for tax
>- Added 5% pension match by the company to my figures

### Current Work Satisfaction

I work 9-6 with a 1-hour lunch break. That is 8 hours a day (assuming I enjoy talking to work people). I work 5 days a week and luckily very rarely work overtime. So 40 hours of potential unhappiness?

Well, let's first talk about holiday. I get 25 days a year base, then I buy 8 additional days, and my company gives me 12 days off for university study. This means that 9 out of 52 weeks I am on holiday. That means I only work 40 × 43 ÷ 52 = 33 hours per week on average.

How much do I enjoy work? This is hard and very project-dependent. If I am writing code, I am normally pretty content, but that depends on the project. Right now I would say I am at about 0.7 on the weighted unhappiness scale for work hours (factoring in that I'm learning, building career capital, and generally not hating the day-to-day). So that makes the total: 23.1 weighted unhappiness hours per week, but it is variable depending on the project mix.

![[Life graph.excalidraw]]

## Where do I want to go

OK, I think up until now maybe I haven't said anything really insightful - I hope the next bit is. As I said before, we want to map the function f that judges how happy I am at each point on this graph.

I am going to define 4 satisfaction levels:
- **Barely bearable**: Life is just about bearable, but I don't think fun is being had
- **Just fine**: Life is acceptable, nothing special
- **Good life**: Life is good, could coast most of my life like this  
- **Made it**: I have essentially made it at this point

![[Life graph contors.excalidraw]]

>[!warning] These are just gut feelings
>I really do wonder if someone offered me the "made it" line if I would take it... I think I would, but I think you only know when the chips are down.

Some things I intuitively think should be true about these satisfaction curves:
- **More pay for same unhappiness = better**: If you are paid more for the same amount of unenjoyable hours, that is better
- **Less unhappiness for same pay = better**: If you spend fewer hours not enjoying yourself for the same pay, that is better  
- **Diminishing returns**: The gradient should increase - as you get hit with more unhappiness, each additional hour of unhappiness should command a higher price

Some things that are maybe just true for me:
- I think I have a cutoff at about 45 hours of unhappiness per week. At that point, no amount of additional money really makes much difference
- If I don't have to work but still get an income, I could really cut down on life expenses
- If I don't have to work, I don't think it will take much money to make me happy
- If I halved my pay but also halved the amount of stuff I don't enjoy doing, that might be worthwhile
- I am doing pretty well right now... I should probably not stress and chill out a bit

## On delayed gratification and the journey vs destination problem

Here's where I need to be honest about something that challenges this whole framework: I'm not sure optimizing for future outcomes is as smart as we think it is.

My great skill is sinking lots of time into things. I did this during my undergrad, working away at studying because I thought getting my degree would be the best thing in the world. I got a good degree, but the moment I got it didn't feel amazing - it felt like somehow I had cheated the system to get it, not really proving I was that great. Though when I reflect on it, "doing the work" I actually found very rewarding.

I then did a PhD - mainly because it was the path of least resistance. The PhD was transformative for me: I lost weight, I developed my thinking, and I made great friends. But during it, I always had the feeling that getting the PhD itself would be amazing... yet once again, when I got it, it felt cheap. I got it during COVID and one of the examiners said "If this was a real viva we would make you do..." Once again, I had somehow cheated the system.

What I mean to say here is I thought I was doing each of these for the golden reward at the end - getting the piece of paper that said I was smart. But ultimately, that wasn't what was rewarding. It was the journey that I loved and the people I met way more than the destination.

This connects to what I've been reading about Stoic and Taoist philosophy. The Stoics teach that you can only control your actions, not their outcomes. The Taoists talk about wu wei - going with the natural flow rather than forcing outcomes. Both traditions suggest that obsessing over destinations we can't control is a recipe for suffering.

**The career capital trap**: We're constantly told to "invest in our careers," to take the boring job that teaches us skills, to network strategically, to build our "brand." But what if you spend years building capital for a career path you end up hating? What if the industry changes? What if you change?

**The path of least resistance isn't lazy**: Maybe choosing what feels right now, what you actually enjoy doing, isn't short-sighted. Maybe it's wisdom. You know you'll take at least two steps in that direction. You don't know if you'll reach some imagined destination.

This suggests we should weight "immediate satisfaction" much more heavily in our framework. Not because we're hedonistic, but because the process is what we actually experience. The destination might be a mirage.

You should pick a journey you want to go on, not a destination you want to be at.

## What does this tell me

I think there are several key takeaways, though I'm holding them more lightly after that philosophical detour:

1. **Evaluate trade-offs carefully, but trust your gut**: The framework says if taking a promotion gives me an extra £1k post-tax monthly income but requires another 5 hours per week of work that I hate... don't do it. But maybe the real insight is simpler: if something feels wrong, it probably is. The framework just helps you articulate why.

2. **The process matters more than the outcome**: I spent years optimizing for getting my degree, then my PhD, only to find the achievement hollow. The learning, growth, and relationships along the way were what mattered. This suggests I should weight "do I enjoy this journey?" much more heavily than "where will this lead?"

3. **I'm not following my own advice (and that's okay)**: Here's the awkward bit - I currently earn £7,500/month but only "need" £4,200 for my lifetime goals. If work is just about solving money problems, why aren't I already working part-time?

   The honest answer is that I'm building a buffer for uncertainty, and I actually don't hate my current work enough to optimize purely for happiness. My current weighted unhappiness is only 23.1 hours per week. More importantly, I'm enjoying the journey right now - learning, building things, working with good people. Maybe that's enough reason to stay.

4. **Retirement doesn't require massive wealth**: When I am retired, I won't need that much money. Not having to work means my hobbies are cheap and I can cut down on lifestyle expenses.

5. **The path of least resistance might be the wisest path**: Instead of constantly pushing uphill toward some imagined better future, maybe I should pay more attention to what feels natural and sustainable right now.

## Thoughts on FIRE

I like the idea of FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early), but I think *The 4-Hour Work Week* has a better approach. Instead of grinding all your time when you are young, relatively responsibility-free, and have energy to earn money for your older self - why not take breaks and spend that money when you are younger? 

Doesn't a year doing what you want sound good? What did your older self (who you don't even know will be around) do to deserve so much money?

When people used to not save at all for retirement, I agree it was an issue. But now retirement savings are so baked into most salaried work that I don't think the old version of me deserves quite so much sacrifice from the current me.

## Framework limitations and evolution

This framework is a snapshot in time, and I recognize it has limitations:

**It's static**: What looks like a good trade-off at 30 might be terrible at 40 with kids, or during a recession. The framework needs regular recalibration as circumstances change.

**It's individualistic**: It doesn't account for how your work affects others - colleagues, family, society. Sometimes the "right" choice for you personally isn't the right choice holistically.

**It's reductive**: Reducing complex decisions to a 2D graph inevitably loses nuance. But I'd rather have an imperfect framework than no framework at all.

The real value isn't in the specific numbers, but in being more intentional about work decisions. Instead of defaulting to "more money is always better" or "I should just be grateful to have a job," it forces me to think about what I'm actually optimizing for.
