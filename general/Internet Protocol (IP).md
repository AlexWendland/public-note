>[!tldr] Internet Protocol (IP)
> This is the only [[Layer 3 Network|layer 3]] protocol and identifies [[Host (networks)|hosts]] on different [[Network|networks]]. Though here are two versions of this [[Protocol (networks)|protocol]] which are [[Internet Protocol (IPv4)|IPv4]] and [[Internet Protocol (IPv6)|IPv6]]. As the names suggests the second [[Protocol (networks)|protocol]] is an updated version of the first. This was mainly brought about as [[We are running out of IPv4 addresses on the pubic internet]].
