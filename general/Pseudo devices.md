>[!tldr] Pseudo devices
>Pseudo devices are not back by real hardware however offer virtual interfaces to the [[Operating system (OS)|OS]]. They offer functionality that is useful for testing, debugging and interacting with the [[Operating system (OS)|OS]]. Examples of some devices in linux are:
>- `/dev/null`: All written data here is discarded.
>- `/dev/zero`: Provided an infinite stream of zero-values when read.
>- `/dev/random`: Generates a cryptographically secure random data.
>- `/dev/urandom`: Generates non-blocking random data.
>- `/dev/full`: Simulates a full disk generating an error when getting written to.
