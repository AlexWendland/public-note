# Retail Price Index (RPI)

The retail price index is an old measure of [[inflation]] in the [[United Kingdom (UK)]] that is no longer used by the government or the [[Bank of England]]. It is a [[Price Index]], a weighted [[Arithmetic mean]] products prices that the average household would buy (including [[Mortgage]] repayments) to indicate a change in the cost of living over time. It's use has now been replaced by the [[Consumer Price Index (CPI)]]. The main differences were
- [[Retail Price Index (RPI)]] included [[Mortgage]] repayment costs, so was heavily influenced by house prices in the [[United Kingdom (UK)]], and
- [[Consumer Price Index (CPI)]] uses the [[Geometric mean]] rather than an [[Arithmetic mean]].
