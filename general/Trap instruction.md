>[!tldr] Trap instruction
>A trap instruction is sent to when an application in [[Proccess modes|user mode]] tries to access hardware without using a [[System call|system call]]. This is passed to the [[Operating system (OS)|OS]] to judge if the call was illegitimate or harmful. Whilst this is happening the process is stopped from doing anything else.
