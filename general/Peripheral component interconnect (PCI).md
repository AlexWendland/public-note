>[!tldr] Peripheral component interconnect (PCI)
>*Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)* is a standard for connecting peripheral devices to a computer's [[Central processing unit (CPU)|CPU]]. It defines a bus that allows hardware components like network cards, sound cards, modems, and storage controllers to communicate with the CPU and memory. PCI supports plug-and-play configuration and allows multiple devices to share the same bus.
