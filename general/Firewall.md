>[!tldr] Firewall
> A firewall introspects [[Packets]] entering a network and filters [[Packets|packets]] out that are selected as malicious or unnecessary.
> This violates the [[End to end principle]] as introspection on the packets happens before they get to their destination. This is seen as needed to protect hosts and [[Network|network]] integrity.
