# Statement

>[!tldr] Max-Satisfiability Problem (Max-SAT problem)
>Provided with a [[Boolean function|boolean function]] $f$ in [[Conjunctive normal form (CNF)|CNF]] with $n$ variables and $m$ clauses, where each variable only appears in a single literal in each clause. What is an assignment maximising the number of satisfied clauses?

# Solutions

- [[Max-SAT random approximation algorithm]]
	- Runs in $O(nm)$ and achieves a $1/2$-approximation.

# Theory
