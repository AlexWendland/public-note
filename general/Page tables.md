>[!tldr] Page tables
>A *page table* maps addresses in the [[Virtual memory|virtual address space]] which is indexed by the [[Virtual page number|virtual page number]] and an offset within that page. The [[Virtual page number|virtual page number]] is mapped to a [[Physical Frame Number (PFN)|physical frame number]] which combined with the offset can identify a location in [[Physical memory|physical memory]].
