>[!tldr] Grim trigger strategy
>Given we have some agreed cooperation strategy $C$ and a strategy that guarantees the [[Minmax profile]] for the other player $P$. The *grim trigger strategy* is as follows, as long as the other player is following strategy $C$ we follow strategy $C$ too - if they ever don't follow strategy $C$ we switch to strategy $P$ for the rest of time.
