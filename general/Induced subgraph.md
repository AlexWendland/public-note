>[!tldr] Induced subgraph
>Given a [[Graph|graph]] $G = (V, E)$ ([[Directed graph|directed graph]] or [[Graph|undirected graph]]) and a subset of the vertices $X \subset V$. The *induced subgraph* of $G$ on $X$ is the [[Subgraph|subgraph]] of $G$ defined by $H = (X, \{(u,v) \in E \vert u,v \in X\})$.
