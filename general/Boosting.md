# Boosting

Boosting is an [[Ensemble learning]] method that uses multiple instances of another model to average them out to make a classifier that is better than any one individual one.

Suppose we are in the [[Modelling framework|modelling framework]] where $B = \{-1,1\}$. We will iteratively train classifiers $h_i: A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
