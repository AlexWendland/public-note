>[!example] Battle of the sexes
>Suppose two friends $A$ and $B$ are going to a town to see a concert. There is two concerts on $x$ and $y$ but unfortunately they forgot to agree which one to go to and can't communicate. They will both be unhappy if they go to a different concert and both get a score $0$. $A$ slightly prefers concert $x$ and if they go there together will get a score of $2$ whereas $B$ gets a score $1$ - whereas it is vice versa for concert $B$. 
>In summary this can be represented in a payoff table as follows.
