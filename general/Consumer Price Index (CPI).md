The [[Consumer Price Index (CPI)]] is the government backed measure of inflation in the [[United Kingdom (UK)]]. It is calculated monthly by the [[Bank of England]]. In the middle of the month the [[Bank of England]] collects the prices of 700 different items from 120,000 different retail outlets. Then it uses these to establish the cost of these product. (*It was not clear to me which average was used here.*) Then they take a weighted (by average use) [[Geometric mean]] of these prices to see the cost of living. ("The [[Geometric mean]] was used instead of the [[Arithmetic mean]] to exaggerate items at the lowest levels." *Don't really understand what they mean by this.*) This is normalised by that cost of the basket at the beginning of the index.
