>[!tldr] Q-function (RL)
>Suppose we are in a [[Markov decision process]] and using [[Discounted rewards|discounted rewards]] define the *Q-function* $Q : S \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ as the solution to the following equations
>$$Q(s,a) = R(s, a) + \gamma \sum_{s' \in S} T(s,a,s') \max_{a' \in A_{s'}} Q(s', a').$$
