>[!tldr] Race condition
>A *race condition* occurs when two or more threads or processes access shared data [[Concurrency|concurrently]] and the final result depends on the timing or order of their execution. Because the outcome varies based on how the threads are scheduled, it leads to unpredictable or incorrect behavior.
