# Internet protocol stack hourglass shape

When you look at the number of [[Protocol (networks)|protocols]] at each layer of the [[Open Systems interconnection (OSI) model|OSI model]] you notice that there is an hour glass shape. With [[Layer 7 Application|layer 7]] and [[Layer 1 Physical|layer 1]] having a variety of [[Protocol (networks)|protocols]] in them buts [[Layer 3 Network|layer 3]] only using a single [[Protocol (networks)|protocol]] the [[Internet Protocol (IP)]]. [[Layer 4 Transport|layer 4]] is dominated by [[User Datagram Protocol (UDP)|UDP]] and [[Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)|TCP]].
