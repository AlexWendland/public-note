# Balance between library providers and users

When developing third-party libraries, creators often aim for wide applicability, packing in a broad range of features to cater to as many use-cases as possible. On the flip side, consumers of these libraries typically have a more narrow focus, needing only a subset of the available functionality. This dynamic can create a form of natural tension between library providers and users. It's like buying a multipurpose tool loaded with features, knowing you'll probably only ever use a few of them.

## Perspectives of Library Providers

- **Wider Adoption**: Library creators desire a broad user base, believing that a multitude of features can attract various types of users.
- **Flexibility**: A comprehensive set of features enables the library to adapt to multiple contexts and needs.
- **Longevity**: Feature-rich libraries are often considered future-proof, capable of adapting to evolving requirements over time.

## Perspectives of Library Users

- **Simplicity**: Users generally prefer a tool that does one thing exceptionally well, as an extensive API increases the cognitive load.
- **Performance**: Unused features could lead to larger application sizes or slower build times, which can be a concern.
- **Dependency Risks**: More features can potentially mean more bugs or security vulnerabilities, increasing the risk associated with library dependency.

## Balancing Acts and Counter-Examples

However, it's worth noting that this tension is not universal or insurmountable:

- **Modular Design**: Some libraries offer a core set of functionalities along with optional modules, allowing users to select only the features they need.
- **Configurability**: Certain libraries provide options to disable or exclude unused features, mitigating performance concerns.
- **Community Support**: A strong user community and comprehensive documentation can alleviate the learning curve, guiding users to the features that are most relevant to their needs.

In summary, while a natural tension may exist between the broad aims of library providers and the focused needs of their users, it's a nuanced relationship. Thoughtful library design and robust community engagement can often bridge the gap, offering a win-win situation for both parties.
