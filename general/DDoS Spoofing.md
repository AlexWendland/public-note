>[!tldr] DDoS Spoofing
>Spoofing is the process of replacing the IP source field of a request. In the context of [[Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)|DDoS]] attacks this can be done in two ways:
>- Changing the address to another legitimate server to waste resources and bandwidth.
>- Changing the address to the host you are attacking so the response is sent to the server under attack.
