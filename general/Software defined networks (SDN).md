>[!tldr] Software defined networks (SDN) 
>This is a paradigm of networking where you use a remote SDN-controller for the control plane for network devices. This has API's for communicating with the data plane of the controlled devices but also an outward API to talk to a further management plane. This allows for central control over a whole [[Autonomous system (AS)|autonomous system]] or [[Network|network]].
