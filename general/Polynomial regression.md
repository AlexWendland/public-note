>[!tldr] Polynomial regression
> In the [[Modelling framework|modelling framework]] saying we are doing *polynomial regression* is saying that we are picking the [[Modelling paradigm|modelling paradigm]] of functions of the form
> $$f(x) = c_0 + \sum_{p \in \Delta_n^k}^n c_{p} x^p$$

> - $\Delta_k^n = \{(p_1, \ldots, p_n) \in \mathbb{N}^n \vert \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \leq k\}$, and
> - $x^p = \prod_{i=1}^n x_i^{p_i}$

> we say $k$ is the degree of our polynomial.
