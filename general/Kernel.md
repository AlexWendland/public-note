>[!tldr] Kernel
>The *kernel* is the core component of an [[Operating system (OS)]] that manages the system's hardware and resources, such as the CPU, memory, and (I/O) devices. It acts as an intermediary between software applications and the physical hardware of a computer. The kernel is responsible for critical tasks, including process management, memory management, device management, and system security.
