# Perceptron rule

This is a way to train a [[Perceptron (neural network)|perceptron]] to classify [[Training data|training data]] where $A = \mathbb{R}^n$ and $B = \{0,1\}$ if the data is [[Linearly separable|linearly separable]]. For this we require a sufficiently small learning rate $\eta \in \mathbb{R}$. The idea is to reply the data nudging the weights of the [[Perceptron (neural network)|perceptron]] slowly towards an even
