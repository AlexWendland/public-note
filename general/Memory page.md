>[!tldr] Memory page
>A _memory page_ is a fixed-size block of memory, determined by the operating system and hardware architecture, typically at system startup. It serves as the fundamental unit of memory management in both [[Physical memory|physical memory]] and [[Virtual memory|virtual memory]]. The operating system, in conjunction with the [[Memory Management Unit (MMU)]], manages this mapping through the use of [[Page table|page tables]] to [[Memory frame|memory frames]].
