>[!tldr] Client-Server model
>The client-server model is a distributed application structure with two roles. There are [[Server|servers]] providing resources and [[Client|clients]] requesting them. For example, a web-server follows the client server model. The user of the browser is the client and the server providing web-pages is the server.
>
>Advantages
>- A service that is centrally managed is easier to monitor.
>- Easier to apply access controls and security to the system.
>- With a centralised system you can gaurentee data integrity more easily.
>
>Disadvantages
>- Single point of failure if the server goes down.
>- Higher start up cost as you require the infrastructure in the first place.
>- Scaling can become complex as the server can become a big bottle neck.
