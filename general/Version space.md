>[!tldr] Version space
>Suppose we are in the [[Modelling framework|modelling framework]] with some training data $T$ and a [[Modelling paradigm|hypothesis space]] $H$. The *version space* for $T$ is 
>$$VS_H(T) = \{h \in H \ \vert \ h(a) = b \mbox{ for all } (a,b) \in T\}.$$
>This is the set of all [[Consistent learner|consistent learners]].
