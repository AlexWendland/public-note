>[!tldr] Fragmentation
>_Fragmentation_ occurs when memory is inefficiently utilized due to gaps or wasted space. It can take two forms:
> - [[Internal fragmentation]] happens when allocated memory blocks are larger than needed, leaving unused space inside them.
>- [[External fragmentation]] happens when free memory is split into non-contiguous blocks, preventing the allocation of a large contiguous region despite sufficient total free space.
