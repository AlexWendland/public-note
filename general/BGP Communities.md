>[!tldr] BGP Communities
>A **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) community** is a mechanism used to group multiple routes together to simplify routing policies and facilitate route management.
>
>1. **Tagging Mechanism**: [[Boarder gateway protocol (BGP)|BGP]] communities are essentially tags or labels that can be applied to routes, allowing routers to apply certain policies to all routes with a specific community tag.    
>2. **Format**: They are typically represented as a 32-bit value, often written in the format `ASN:NN` ([[Autonomous system number (ASN)]]: Number) with both sides be 16-[[Bit|bit]] values.  
>3. **Usage**:
>    - **Policy Control**: They help in implementing routing policies such as route preference, route filtering, and traffic engineering.
>    - **Route Management**: Simplify the management of routing information by allowing bulk changes to be made to routes that share the same community tag.
>    - **DDoS Mitigation**: Specific community values, like those used in BGP blackholing (e.g., `ASN:666`), can be used to signal special actions such as dropping traffic to mitigate [[Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)|DDoS]] attacks.
>4. **Propagation**: Communities are transitive, meaning they can be passed along to other routers within the same [[Autonomous system (AS)|AS]] or to other ASes, depending on the routing policies configured.  
>5. **Flexibility**: Operators can define custom community values to meet their specific needs, making BGP communities a versatile tool in network management.
>In summary, BGP communities are a powerful and flexible tool for managing routing policies and enhancing the control over how routes are handled and propagated across networks.
