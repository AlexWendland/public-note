>[!tldr] Search problem
>A problem is a *search problem* if we can verify a solution in [[Polynomial time|polynomial time]]. 
>
>Formally:
>
>The problem is of the form, for a given instance $I$ of the problem you can either:
>- find a solution $S$ for $I$ if one exists, or
>- output no if $I$ has no solutions.
>
>Then this problem is a *search problem* if given an instance $I$ and a solution $S$ then we can verify that $S$ is a solution to $I$ in [[Polynomial time|polynomial time]] in $\vert I \vert$.
