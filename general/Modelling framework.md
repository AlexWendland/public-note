>Suppose we have some random variable we want to predict $Y$ and some set of features or predictors to make predictions of $Y$ from in $X$. You assume there is some relationship between $Y$ and $X$ given by
>$$Y = f(X) + \epsilon.$$
>Where $\epsilon$ is some [[Irreducible error]] within our system.
