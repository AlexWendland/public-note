# Side effect

In programming, a side effect of a [[Function conventions|subroutine]] is the effect it has on things outside its domain. For example updating a database, changing a global variable, or changing an input [[Mutability|mutable]] variable. It is [[Function conventions#Have no side effects|good practice]] to avoid doing this at all costs. It makes your code harder to understand and debugging even worse!
