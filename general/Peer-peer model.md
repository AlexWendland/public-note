>[!tldr] Peer-peer model
>The peer-to-peer model is a decentralised application architecture which has each participant being both consumer and provider of resources. Each peer offers some of its resources up to the network for other peers to use without central coordination. An example of this is Torrent file sharing.
>
>Advantages
>- Naturally scales as more people use the system.
>- Cost effective as there is no centrally managed servers.
>- Fault tolerant as any number of nodes going down does not stop the system working.
>
>Disadvantages
>- Security challenges as no central authority is dictating who is allowed into the network.
>- Can not guarantee data integrity of assets on the network. 
>- Hard to manage and monitor as there is no central place collecting logs.
