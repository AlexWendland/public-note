# Degree (graph)

In a [[Graph|graph]] the *degree* of vertex is the number of ends of edges that are incidence to the vertex. This is denoted $\mbox{deg}(v)$ for some $v \in V$.

In a graph with no [[Loop (graph)|loops]] this is the same as the number of edges that are incident to the vertex. However, for evert [[Loop (graph)|loop]] in the graph on that vertex we have a contribution of 2 towards the vertex.
