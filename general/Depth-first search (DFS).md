# Depth-first search (DFS)

This is a way of traversing a [[Graph|graph]] (could be a [[Directed graph|directed graph]] or [[Graph|undirected graph]]). It explores all the way down one branch of the graph before tracing and exploring other branches.

The generally runs in $O(\vert V \vert + \vert E \vert)$ time.

## Examples

- [[DFS to find connected components in an undirected graph]]
- [[DFS to find path in a directed graph]]
- [[DFS to find path in an undirected graph]]
