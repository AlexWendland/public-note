>[!tldr] ARP Cache
>The ARP cache of a [[Node (IPv6)|node]] in a [[Network|network]] is a mapping from [[Internet Protocol (IP)|IP addresses]] within the same [[Network|network]] to their [[MAC address]]. A [[Node (IPv6)|node]] can identify a [[Internet Protocol (IP)|IP address]] within its [[Network|network]] using the [[Network mask|network mask]]. This gets updated using the [[Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)]].
