# Statement

> [!important] Lemma
> For a [[Linear programme|linear programme]] given by $A, b,$ and $c$ if we take the [[Dual linear programme|dual linear programme]] and then the [[Dual linear programme|dual linear programme]] of that we get back to the original [[Linear programme|linear programme]].

# Proof

Just following the definition the [[Dual linear programme|dual linear programme]] is defined by $-A^T$, $-c$ and $-b$. Then the [[Dual linear programme|dual linear programme]] of that is given by $-(-A^T)^T$, $-(-b)$ and $-(-c)$ which by laws of [[Linear Algebra|linear algebra]] give us $A$, $b$ and $c$ back.
