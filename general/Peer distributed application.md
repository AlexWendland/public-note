>[!tldr] Peer distributed application
>A Peer distributed application is a [[Distributed algorithm|distributed algorithm]] where nodes in the network act not only as clients (receivers of data) but also as servers (or producers). This is distinguished from a [[Peer-peer model]] as there may still be some privileged nodes in the network that handle more of the management workload.
