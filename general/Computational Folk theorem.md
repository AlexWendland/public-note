# Statement

> [!important] Lemma
> For any 2-player [[Discounted rewards|discounted reward]] repeated game it is possible to build a Povlov-like machine with is [[Subgame perfect]] and can achieve [[Nash equilibrium]] in polynomial time. This is done in one of three ways
> - Pavlov if it is possible,
> - Make it [[Zero-sum game|zero-sum]] (like) and solve using a [[Linear programme|linear programme]], or
> - at most one player can improve.

# Proof
