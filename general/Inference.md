>[!tldr] Inference
>In the [[Modelling framework|modelling framework]] for a function $f: A \rightarrow B$ an *inference* about $f$ is some understanding of its True form. For example, if $A$ was a companies revenue and expenditure and $f$ was the profit function, an inference would be that $f$ is revenue minus expenditure.
