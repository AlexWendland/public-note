>[!tldr] Memory Management Unit (MMU)
>The _Memory Management Unit (MMU)_ is a hardware component responsible for translating [[Virtual memory|virtual addresses]] used by programs into [[Physical memory|physical addresses]]. It works alongside the [[Operating system (OS)|operating system]] and uses [[Page tables|page tables]] or [[Segment table|segment tables]] to perform this translation. The MMU also enforces memory protection, preventing unauthorized access to restricted memory regions.
