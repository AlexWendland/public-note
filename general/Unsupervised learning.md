>[!tldr] Unsupervised learning
>In *unsupervised learning* we are given an input [[Function domain|domain]] $A$ with some [[Training data|training data]] $T \subset A$ which are not labelled (you may or may not be provided with an output [[Function codomain|codomain]] $B$) . The goal is to make some $f: A \rightarrow B$ (and $B$) that groups items that are "related" to one another given $T$.
