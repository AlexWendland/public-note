# Fast API

This is a [[Python Index|python]] library to implement an [[Application Programming Interface (API)|API]]. Whilst there are other [[API]] implementations in python such as [[Flask]] the unique selling point of Fast API is it's speed.

Similarly to [[Flask]] this is implemented mainly by using [[decorators]] to wrap functions to turn them into end points.
