>[!tldr] Atomic instruction
>An atomic instruction in computer systems is an operation that is indivisible â€” it either completes entirely or does not happen at all, with no intermediate state visible to other threads or processors. Atomicity is crucial in [[Concurrency|concurrent]] programming to avoid [[Race condition|race condition]] when multiple threads access and modify shared data.
