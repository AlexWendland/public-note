>[!tldr] Spurious wakeups
>When waking up [[Thread|threads]] in a [[Mutex|mutex]] block using signal/broadcast lf you still hold the mutex then the threads will just be moved to waiting on the mutex as it is still held. This is a *spurious wakeup* as we pay the cost of  [[Context switch (CPU)|context switching]] to the thread just to hand back control to the [[Central processing unit (CPU)|CPU]].
