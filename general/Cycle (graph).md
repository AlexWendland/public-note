# Cycle (graph)

A *cycle* in a [[Graph|graph]] is [[Path (graph)|path]] $\{e_i = (x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^{k}$  such that $x_1 = y_k$ and $e_i = e_j \Rightarrow i = j$.

> [!example] Visual representation
> Lets use our simple [[graph]] below
> ![[simple_cycle]]
> In this graph we have a cycle using the vertices $\{1,2,3\}$.
