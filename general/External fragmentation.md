>[!tldr] External fragmentation
>_External fragmentation_ occurs when free memory is split into small, non-contiguous blocks, making it impossible to allocate a large contiguous block despite having enough total free space. This happens in systems that use variable-sized allocations (e.g., [[Memory segmentation|segmentation]] or [[Heap (OS)|heap]] memory management). For example if a program repeatedly allocates and frees different-sized memory chunks, gaps form between allocated blocks, preventing large allocations.
