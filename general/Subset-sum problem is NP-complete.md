# Statement

> [!important] Lemma
> [[Subset-sum problem]] is [[NP-Complete]].

# Proof
We already know the [[Subset-sum problem is in NP]]. So we need to show it is [[NP-hard]]. To do this we will make a [[Many-one reduction (problem)|many-one reduction]] from the [[k-satisfiability problem (k-SAT problem)|3-SAT]] problem.
