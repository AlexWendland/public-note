>[!tldr] Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension
>Suppose we are in the [[Modelling framework|modelling framework]] with feature space $A$, domain $B$, and we have [[Modelling paradigm|hypothesis space]] $H$. The *VC-dimension* of $H$ is the size of the largest set $S \subset A$ such that for all $l: S \rightarrow B$ there exists $h_l \in H$ such that $h_l(s) = l(s)$ for all $s \in S$.
