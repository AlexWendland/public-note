>[!tldr] Network mask
>A network mask is a mask that gets applied to an [[Internet Protocol (IP)|IP address]]. These are normally of the form  0.0.0.0 (empty mask), 255.0.0.0 (use the first 8 [[Bit|bits]] of the address), 255.255.0.0 (first 16 [[Bit|bits]]), 255.255.255.0 (first 24 [[Bit|bits]]), or 255.255.255.255 to use the whole address.
