# Introduction to statistical learning with Applications in Python

This is a book by multiple authors about [[Machine Learning]] I was reading with a bunch of my friends. You can find it in my [[ISLP_website.pdf|repo]] or for free on their [website](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLP/ISLP_website.pdf.download.html).
