# Markdown

This is a [[Markup Language]] that is widely used, for example it is used in [[Github]] README pages and [[Obsidian]] notes. It has a fairly basic syntax, that I am going to have great fun describing in a [[Markdown]] file.

# Syntax

## Headings 
Are done by starting a line with \#'s with the number being the level up to a depth of 6! For example:

\# Important heading,

or

\#\#\#\# Less important heading. 

But,

\#\#\#\#\#\#\# this will look exactly like this as it isn't a heading.

## Bold 
A statement is made **bold** by wrapping it in  \*\* or \_\_ for example: 
- \*\*bold\*\*, or
- \_\_bold\_\_!

## Italic 
A statement is **italicised** by wrapping it in \* or \_, for example:
- \*oh hey there\*, or
- \_hiya\_.

## Italic and bold
You do both the above by literally adding them together, so wrap it in \*\*\* or \_\_\_ (note a mix also works). For example:
- \*\*\*dude this is so important\*\*\*,
- \_\_\_yeah tots\_\_\_, or 
- \*\*\_so radical\_\*\*.

1. hi
8. yo
3. this is strange
